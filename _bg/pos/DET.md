### Definition

Determiners are words that modify [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases and
express the reference of the noun phrase in context. That is, a
determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or
indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to
an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular
number or quantity, etc.

In Bulgarian the definite article is part of the word, thus it is not considered
as determiner.

However, the following pronouns are mapped to [detereminers](DET):

- demonstratives: Pda#, Pde#
- relatives: Pra#, Pre#, Prp#
- collectives: Pca#, Pce#
- interrogatives: Pia#, Pie#, Piy#, Pip#
- indefinites: Pfa#, Pfe#, Pfp#
- negatives: Pna#, Pne#, Pnp#
- possessives: Ps@l

Note that the attributive usages (#a#) and possessive attributive usages (#p#) go directly into DET category, while entities (#e#) can be either
determiners or pronouns. The possessive pronouns (Ps#) are mapped with only their long forms (#l#). 
The short forms are clitics and will be treated differently.


### Examples

- possessive determiners: _мой_ / _moy_ "my", _твой_ / tvoy "your"
- demonstrative determiners: _тази / _tazi__ "this" as in _Вчера видях тази кола_ / _Vchera vidyah tazi kola_ "I saw <b>this</b> car yesterday."
- interrogative determiners: _какъв_ / _kakav_ "which.MASC.SG"
- relative determiners: _какъвто_ / _kakavto_ "which.MASC.SG"
- indefinite determiners: _някакъв_ / _nyakakav_ "some.MASC.SG"
- collective determiners: _всякакъв_ / _vsyakakav_ "any.MASC.SG"
- negative determiners: _никакъв_ / _nikakav_ "no.MASC.SG"

Note that the symbol `#', used in the Universal POS section indicates a holder for arbitrary number of features, suppressed in the respective tag as irrelevant in the BulTreeBank tagset, when mapped to the Universal one.

The symbol `@' marks the suppresion with one feature in the tag.
