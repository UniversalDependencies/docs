### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions
by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating
conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the
status of a (subordinate) clause.

We follow [Loos et al. 2003](http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsASubordinatingConjunctio.htm) in recognizing these three subclasses as subordinating conjunctions:

* Complementizers, like [en] _that_ or _if_
* Adverbial clause introducers, like [en] _when_, _since_, or _before_ (when introducing a clause, not a nominal)
* Non-pronominal relativizers, like [he] _še_. Words in this category simply introduce a relative clause (and normally don't inflect). This excludes words that have a nominal function within the relative clause; relative and resumptive pronouns (e.g., English relative _that_ and _which_) are analyzed as [PRON]().

For _coordinating conjunctions,_ see [CCONJ]().

### Examples

- _that_ as in _I believe <b>that</b> he will come._
- _if_
- _while_
