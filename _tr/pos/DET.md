### Definition

Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express
the reference of the noun phrase in context. That is, a determiner may
indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite
element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to an element
belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular number or
quantity, etc.

Traditionally, Turkish grammars and dictionaries do not make the distinction between a determiner and an adjective (but modern grammars do, see Göksel and Kerslake 2005, ch.15).

Turkish does not have a definite article,
but the numeral _bir_ "one" also acts as an indefinite article.
We mark it as `DET` in this usage.

### Examples

- demonstrative determiners: _bu_ "this", _şu_ "this/that", _o_ "that"
- interrogative determiners: _hangi_ "which", _kaç_ "how many"
- quantity/quantifier determiners: _bütün_ "all", _bazı_ "some",
  _hiçbir_ "none"
