Latvian features gender for nouns ([`NOUN`](), [`PROPN`]()), adjectives ([`ADJ`]()), some numerals ([`NUM`]()), some participles ([`VERB`]() with [`VerbForm=Part`](VerbForm) or [`VerbForm=Conv`](VerbForm)) and some pronouns ([`PRON`]() and [`DET`]()).

Values used:

* `Masc`
* `Fem`

Values not used:

* `Neut`
* `Com`

Traditional dictionaries describe some nouns, e.g., _bende_, _aitasgalva_ as having common gender, but in Latvian Treebank these are anotated as masculine or feminine based on context and/or singular dative form which differs depending on contextual gender.
