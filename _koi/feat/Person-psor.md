Person[psor]
is possessor's person, marked on Hungarian nouns. These noun
forms would be translated to English as possessive pronoun + noun.

This layered feature is conveniently used for possessive inflections
of nouns, although nouns normally do not have a `Person` feature,
meaning that no other layers are needed. Nevertheless, the possessive
morphology typically also includes `Number`, which must be multi-layered
on nouns, and we thus have `Person[psor]` together with `Number[psor]`.

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person possessor

#### Examples

* [koi] _зон_ “son”
* [koi] _<b>зонӧ</b>_ “my son”
* [koi] _<b>зонным</b>_ “our son”

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person possessor

#### Examples

* [koi] _зон_ “son”
* [koi] _<b>зоныт</b>_ “your.Sing son”
* [koi] _<b>зонныт</b>_ “your.Plur son”

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person possessor

#### Examples

* [koi] _зон_ “son”
* [koi] _<b>зоныс</b>_ “his/her/its son”
* [koi] _<b>зонныс</b>_ “their son”
