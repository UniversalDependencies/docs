The `discourse:filler` subtype of the [discourse]() relation is used in spoken data for speaker sounds acting as filled pauses to prolong planning time (they correspond to a pause rather than a real word).
The filler is attached to the head of the most relevant clause (usually the root of the sentence), even if this causes non-projectivity.
