Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
[verb](myv-pos/VERB) forms.

### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in the
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* [myv] _мон <b>содан</b>_ "I <b>know</b>"

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperative

The speaker uses the imperative to order or ask the addressee to perform the
action of the verb, the subject is limited to the second person.

#### Examples

* [myv] _<b>паник</b> каштомсо_ "_<b>bake it</b> in the oven_"

### <a name="Sub">`Sub`</a>: conjunctive (subjunctive)

The conjunctive mood (also subjunctive) is attested in both the main clause and subordinate clauses. It is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen.
The conjunctive is also used to express volition in both proclamations and questions

#### Examples

* [myv] _<b>молевлинек</b> кинов_ "we <b>would like to go</b> to the movies"

### <a name="Cnd">`Cnd`</a>: conditional

The conditional mood is used to express conditions, i.e. protasis, for actions of the main clause. This mood marker can be found in finite and non-finite forms alike, as well as followed by derivational suffixes.

#### Examples

* [myv] _<b>молиндерятано</b> кинов, а ванови телевидениянь программась_ "<b>if we go</b> to the movies, we won't see the t.v. program"

### <a name="CndSub">`CndSub`</a>: conditional-conjunctive

The conditional-conjunctive is attested in the subordinate clause, and, depending on the language variant, its constituents may alternate in order.

#### Examples

* [myv] _Паро улевель <b>максовольтьдеряй</b> моненьгак лишме._ "It would be good if the were to give me a horse, too."

### <a name="Des">`Des`</a>: desiderative

The desiderative mood is used to express desired or potential actions that are not fulfilled.

#### Examples

* [myv] _<b>молексэлинек</b> кинов_ "we <b>would have gone</b> to the movies (, but we didn't go)"
* [myv] _<b>прыксэлинек</b>_ "we <b>almost fell over</b> (, but we didn't)"

### <a name="Opt">`Opt`</a>: optative

The optative is used for three persons in two numbers. It expresses a concessive attitude and at time resultative.

#### Examples

* [myv] _ков <b>илязат</b> моле, сайть свал конёв мартот_ "where ever <b>you don't</b> go, always take paper with you (where ever you go,...)"
