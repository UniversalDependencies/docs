### Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes. They may also function as predicates, as in

_O carro é <b>verde</b>._ "The car is green."

Adjectives in Portuguese agree in number and gender with the noun they modify, e.g. _a casa <b>amarela</b>_ (femenine singular), _as casas <b>amarelas</b>_ (femenine plural).

<!--The class of adjectives in Portuguese UD also includes _ordinal numbers_ and _participial adjectives_, both behaving as adjectives morphologically and syntactically. Note that _participles_ are word forms that may share properties and usage of adjectives and verbs. Depending on context, they may be classified as either [VERB]() or ADJ. 

commented it since I think participial adjectives are always marked as verb in the newest corpora.

-->

To conform to the UD guidelines, possessive adjectives are handled as determiners [DET]().

### Examples

* _grande_ "big"
* _velho_ "old"
* _verde_ "green"
* _incompreensível_ “incomprehensible”
* _primeiro_ "first", _segundo_ "second", _terceiro_ "third"
