Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
verb forms.

### `Ind`: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* _Io scrivo una lettera_ "I write a letter"

### `Imp`: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.

#### Examples

* _Mangia la tua insalata!_ "Eat your salad!"

### `Cnd`: conditional

The conditional mood is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen.

#### Examples

* _Mi sarei divertito_ "I would have enjoyed myself"

### `Pot`: potential

Not used.

### `Sub`: subjunctive / conjunctive

The subjunctive mood is used under certain circumstances in
subordinate clauses, typically for actions that are subjective or
otherwise uncertain.

#### Examples

* _Voglio che tu te ne <b>vada</b> "I want you to leave"

### `Jus`: jussive

Not used.

### `Qot`: quotative

Not used.

### `Opt`: optative

Not used.

### `Des`: desiderative

Not used.

### `Nec`: necessitative
