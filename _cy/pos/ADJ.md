#### Description

Adjectives typically modify nouns. In Welsh, in general the adjective follows the noun, and for certain adjectives agrees in gender and number.


#### Examples

* _cŵn **duon**_  "black dogs"
* _tŷ **gwyn**_  "white house"
* _**hen** bont_ "old bridge"

Adjectives become adverbs by using the predicative particle _yn_

* _Mae hi'n rhedeg **yn gyflym**_ "she is running fast"
