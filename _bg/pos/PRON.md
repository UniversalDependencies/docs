### Definition

Pronouns are words that substitute for [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases,
whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic
context.

Pronouns under this definition function like nouns. 

The BulTreeBank annotation scheme adopted the idea that pro-nouns,
pro-adjectives and pro-adverbs are labeled as Pronouns.
However, for the mapping to the universal tagset, this group was split into
several parts-of-speech: [determiners](DET), [adverbs](ADV), [pronouns](PRON).

The tags that correspond to `Pron` are: Pp#, Pde#, Pre#, Pce#, Pie#, Pfe#, Pfy#, Pne#, Piy#.

### Examples

- personal pronouns (Pp#): _аз, ти, той, тя, то, ние, те, него, го_ / _az, ti, toy, tya, to, nie, te, nego, go_ "I, you, he, she, it, we, they, him.LONG.FORM, him.SHORT.FORM"
- reflexive personal pronouns (Ppx#): _себе си, се_ / _sebe si, se_ "myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, theirselves"
- demonstrative pronouns (Pde#): _този, това_ / _tozi, tova_ "this" as in _Видях това вчера._ / _Vidyah tova vchera_ "I saw <b>this</b> yesterday."
- interrogative pronouns (Pie#, Piy#): _кой, какво, колцина_ / __koy, kakvo, koltsina_ "who, what, how many" as in _Какво мислиш?_ / _Kakvo mislish? "<b>What</b> do you think?"
- relative pronouns (Pre#): _който, каквото_ / __koyto, kakvoto_ "who, what" as in _Човекът, който дойде, е баща ми._ /_Chovekat, koyto doyde, e bashta mi_ "The person <b>who</b> came is my father."
- indefinite pronouns (Pfe#, Pfy#): _някой, нещо, неколцина_ / _nyakoy, neshto, nekoltsina_ "somebody, something, some, anybody, anything, any"
- collective pronouns (Pce#): _всеки, всичко_ / _vseki, vsichko_ "everybody, everything"
- negative pronouns (Pne#): _никой, нищо_ / _nikoy, nishto_ "nobody, nothing"

Note that the symbol `#', used in the Universal POS section indicates a holder for arbitrary number of features, suppressed in the respective tag as irrelevant in the BulTreeBank tagset, when mapped to the Universal one.
