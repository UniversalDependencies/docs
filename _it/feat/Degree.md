Degree of comparison is used as an inflectional feature of some
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](u-pos/ADV).

### <a name="Cmp">`Cmp`</a>: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object.

#### Examples

* _Luigi è migliore di me_ "Luigi is better than me"
* _Il prezzo è inferiore_ "The price is lower"

### <a name="Sup">`Sup`</a>: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set.

Italian does not seem to have single words for 'relative'
superlatives, such as [en] "youngest". One would say instead:

#### Examples

* _Luigi è il più giovane_ "Luigi is the most young"

### <a name="Abs">`Abs`</a>: absolute superlative

The quality of the given object is so strong that there is hardly any other object
exceeding it. The quality is not actually compared to any particular
set of objects.

#### Examples

* _bellissimo_ "very beatiful", _massimo_ "maximum", _malissimo_ "very badly", _ottimo_ "optimum"
