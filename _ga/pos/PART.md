Morphological features are important for the specification of particle types. Irish makes use of a broad range of particles. It is important to differentiate these particles, because in some cases they share the same form, yet have different functions. For
example, _a_ can be a vocative particle, relative particle, infinitive particle or quantifier particle, and trigger a variety of different spelling changes (e.g. eclipsis, h-prefix or lenition).
