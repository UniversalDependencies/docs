### Definition

A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function, or both.

Many symbols are or contain special non-alphanumeric, non-standard logographic characters, similarly to punctuation. What makes them different from punctuation is that they can be substituted by normal words. This involves all currency symbols, e.g. _$ 75_ is identical to _七十五 蚊_ / _cat1sap6ng5 man1_ "seventy-five dollars".

Mathematical operators form another group of symbols.

Another group of symbols is emoticons and emoji.
