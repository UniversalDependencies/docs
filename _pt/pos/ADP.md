### Definition

Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions.
Adpositions belong to a closed set of items that occur before
(preposition) or after (postposition) a complement composed of a noun
phrase, noun, pronoun, or clause that functions as a noun phrase, and
that form a single structure with the complement to express its
grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.

In many languages, as Portuguese, adpositions can take the form of fixed multiword
expressions, such as _gra√ßas a_, _por causa de_ ("thanks to", "because of"). 
<!-- The component words are then still tagged according to their basic use
(_in_ is `ADP`, _spite_ is [NOUN](), etc.) and their status as
multiword expressions are accounted for in the syntactic annotation. -->


### Examples

- _em_, _de_
- _para_, _a_ (preposition)
