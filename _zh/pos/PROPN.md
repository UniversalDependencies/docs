###  Definition

A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word, or substantive) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object. Syntactically a proper noun cannot be preceded by numerals and classifiers but a common noun can. For institutional names that have clear internal structure and contain regular words belonging to other parts of speech such as nouns (_e.g._, 公司 / _gōngsī_ "company", 大學 / _dàxué_ "university", _etc_.), those words should be segmented as their own tokens and still tagged their native part of speech; only the proper nouns in such complex names should be tagged PROPN.

### Examples

- 孔子 / _kǒngzǐ_ "Confucius"
- 亞洲 / _yàzhōu_ "Asia"
- <b>威威</b> 木材 公司 ／ _<b>wēiwēi</b> mùcái gōngsī_ "<b>Weiwei</b> Timber Company"
