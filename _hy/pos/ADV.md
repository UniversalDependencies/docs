### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [verbs](VERB) for such categories as time, place, direction or manner. They may also modify
[adjectives](ADJ) and other adverbs, as in _<b>հավանաբար</b> սխալ&nbsp;_ “probably wrong” or _<b>շատ</b> հազվադեպ&nbsp;_ “very rarely”.

There is a closed subclass of _pronominal adverbs_ that refer to circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly; similarly
to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, relative, demonstrative, indefinite. Pronominal adverbs also get the `ADV` part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional features.

Note that verb forms such as _transgressives_ (also called _adverbial participles_, e.g. _տեսա <b>գրելիս</b>&nbsp;_ “I saw him writing” or _<b>կարդալիս</b> քնեց&nbsp;_ “when reading he slept”) share properties and usage of adverbs and verbs. Note that Armenian transgressives are tagged [VERB](), not `ADV`.

Note that in Armenian some adverbs inflect for [Degree](). Second degree specified by adverb _<b>ավելի</b>_ “more” e.g. _<b>ավելի</b> արագ&nbsp;_ “more quickly”. The third degree of adverbs in Armenian is constructed with the feature of [Definite]().
