In Irish, there is a distinction between the substantive verb _bí_ `to be', which
inflects for tense, mood and person as per all Irish verbs -- and the copula _is_, which
only has two tensed forms - present/future and past/conditional.


_Bí_, as a verb, uses separate particles in negative and interrogative constructions. 
_Is_ (copula) uses its own forms in these constructions. See the table below for more information regarding different forms of the copula.
 

The order of elements in a copular construction is usually as follows: 
<b>copula</b>, <b>predicate</b> (new or focussed information), and <b>subject</b>. See [root](https://universaldependencies.org/ga/dep/root.html) for further information on how the root is identified in a copular construction and examples of the copula-predicate-subject structure. 

`cop` is used to link the copula verb _is_ and its predicate. See [xcomp:pred]() to see how the verb _bí_ is linked to a predicate.

The various forms of the copula, which occurs in the both present and past tenses and in the conditional mood are labelled 'cop'.

||  Present tense/Future tense|Past tense/Conditional mood|
|--|--|--|
| 	*Affirmative* | is | ba / b'
| 	*Negative* | ní |níor / níorbh
| 	*Interrogative* | an |ar / arbh
| 	*Negative Interrogative* | nach |nár / nárbh
| 	*Dependent* | gur/gurb |gur / gurbh
| 	*Negative Dependent* | nach |nár / nárbh

NOTE: Other forms of the copula such as the copula in the form of a relative pronoun in the past tense or in the superlative ('ab') and contracted copula forms ('Sé/'Sí/Seo/Sin) also bear the label 'cop'. The copular conjunction 'ná' is currently treated as either 'mark' or 'cc'.
