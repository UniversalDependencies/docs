This is a subtype of [aux](), used for the conditional auxiliary _бу_.

The conditional auxiliary, when attached to a predicate,
typically carries the conditional modality found in finite verbal forms but not non-finites.

~~~ sdparse
Якамс бу лия таркав. \n If we could go to a different place.
aux:cnd(Якамс, бу)
~~~
