A dependency is labeled as `dep` when a system is unable to
determine a more precise dependency relation between two words. This
may be because of a weird grammatical construction, a limitation in
software, a parser error, or because of an unresolved long distance 
dependency.

In the current version of the Swedish UD treebank, the _dep_ relation is not used at all.
