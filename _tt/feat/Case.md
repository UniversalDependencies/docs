Case helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence.
For example, the nominative and accusative cases often distinguish subject and object of the verb,
while in fixed-word-order languages these functions would be distinguished merely by the positions of the nouns in the sentence.

In Turkish, case is an inflectional feature of [nouns](tt-pos/NOUN).  In some cases, [numerals](tt-pos/NUM)) may also be inflected for case when they are used as nouns.

Traditionally, Tatar is considered to have 6 cases: `Nom` (Nominative), `Acc` (Accusative), `Gen` (Genitive), `Dat` (Dative), `Loc` (Locative), and `Abl` (Ablative).
We also consider suffix *-ча* or *-чә* as a `Equ` (Equative) case suffix. This treatment enables flexible morphological analyses for rather productive expressions such as _әйт-ү-ен-чә_ (say-VNoun-3-Equ) "according to him".

### <a name="Nom">`Nom`</a>: nominative / direct

The base form of the noun, typically used as citation form (lemma).

#### Examples

* _<b>Кыз</b> йоклый._ "The <b>girl</b> sleeps."

### <a name="Acc">`Acc`</a>: accusative

Tatar usually marks a definite direct object with accusative case.
Indefinite direct objects do not receive the accusative suffix, but stays in the bare form (`Nom`).

In Tatar `Acc` is expressed by the suffix _-ны_ or _-не_ when the noun does not have a 3rd person possessive suffix;
when it does, it is expressed by the suffix _-н_.

#### Examples

* _Китап<b>ны</b> укыдым_ "I read (past) the book" (cf. _Китап укыдым_ "I read (past) a book / books")

### <a name="Dat">`Dat`</a>: dative

Dative case is typically used to indicate movement into/towards/to a place or time.
The oblique arguments of some verbs and complements (noun phrases) of some postpositions also required to be in dative case.

In Tatar `Dat` is expressed by the suffix _-га, ка, гә,_ or _кә_.

#### Examples

* _Казан<b>га</b> барам_ "I am going <b>to</b> Kazan"
* _Китапны Марат<b>ка</b> бир_ "Give the book <b>to</b> Marat"
* _Иртәгә<b>гә</b> кадәр көтәбез_ "We will wait till tomorrow" (postposition _кадәр_ "till" requires a dative complement)

### <a name="Gen">`Gen`</a>: genitive

A prototypical meaning of genitive is that the noun phrase belongs to its governor in some manner;
it would often be translated by the English preposition _of_.
Complements of some postpositions are also required to be in genitive case.
The genitive morpheme may also mark the subject of some sorts of subordinate clauses (cf. Exceptional Case Marking).

In Tatar, `Gen` is expressed by the suffix _-ның_ or _нең_.

#### Examples

* _Марат<b>ның</b> китабы_ "Marat<b>'s</b> book"
* _Марат<b>ның</b> Америкага барганы бар_ "Marat has been to America" (lit. "There is Marat's going to America")
* _Марат<b>ның</b> китабы бар_ "Marat has a book"

### <a name="Loc">`Loc`</a>: locative

The locative case often expresses location in space or time, which gave it its name.
The oblique arguments of some verbs and complements (noun phrases) also required to be in locative case.

In Tatar `Loc` is expressed by the suffix _-да, -дә, -та,_ or _-тә_.

#### Examples

* _Мин өй<b>дә</b>_ "I am <b>at</b> home"
* _Оешма сәгать алты<b>да</b>_ "The meeting is <b>at</b> six"

### <a name="Abl">`Abl`</a>: ablative

A noun with ablative typically means a starting point from which something moves away.
The oblique arguments of some verbs and the complements (noun phrases) of some postpositions are also required to be in ablative case.
Ablative is also used as a denominator in fraction numerals.

In Tatar `Abl` is marked by _-дан, -дән, -тан, -тән, -нан,_ or _-нән_.

#### Examples

* _Казан<b>нан</b> килде_ "He/She came <b>from</b> Kazan"
* _Китапны Марат<b>тан</b> алдым_ "I took/bought the book <b>from</b> Marat"
* _Укытучыбыз<b>дан</b> сорыйк_ "Let's ask our teacher" (The verb _сора-_ "to ask" requires an ablative oblique for someone to be asked)
* _Бу алманы кибет<b>тән</b> сатып алдым_ "I bought this apple at the store" (the location of purchase is marked with ablative)
* _биш<b>тән</b> дүрт_ "four fifths"

### <a name="Equ">`Equ`</a>: equative

In Tatar, The equative case means "X-like", "according to X", "X-ish", etc.
This case-marking is productive, but is more restricted than other cases.
