### Definition

Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions.
Adpositions belong to a closed set of items that occur before
(preposition) or after (postposition) a complement composed of a noun
phrase, noun, pronoun, or clause that functions as a noun phrase, and
that form a single structure with the complement to express its
grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.

In many languages, adpositions can take the form of fixed multiword
expressions, such as _in spite of_, _because of_, _thanks to_. The
component words are then still tagged according to their basic use
(_in_ is `ADP`, _spite_ is [NOUN](), etc.) and their status as
multiword expressions are accounted for in the syntactic annotation.

Note that in Germanic languages, some prepositions may also function
as verbal particles, as in _give <b>in</b>_ or _hold <b>on</b>_. They
are still tagged `ADP` and not [PART]().
