### Definition

An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or
part of an exclamation. It typically expresses an emotional reaction,
is not syntactically related to other accompanying expressions, and
may include a combination of sounds not otherwise found in the
language. In Portuguese, we have interjections that are multi word expressions, as _Deus me livre_ and _pois é_.


Note that words primarily belonging to another part of speech retains
their original category when used in exclamations. For example, _God_
is a [NOUN]() even in exclamatory uses. (This is an issue in our current version.)

As a special case of interjections, we recognize feedback particles
such as _taí_, _não_, etc.

### Examples

- _bingo_
