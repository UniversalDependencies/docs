#####Definition
Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context. 

In Norwegian, the personal pronouns are the only words that inflect for case (nominative/accusative).

The relativizer *som* "that" is counted as a relative pronoun even though there are linguistic reasons to treat it as a subordinating conjunction (`SCONJ`). This is done in order to preserve information about the function of the antecedent in the syntactic analysis. Note that *som* "that" may also function as a preposition and will then receive the `ADP` tag (_fortsette <b>som</b>  leder_ "continue as leader").

#####Examples
* personal: *han* "he", *hun* "she", *det* "it", *ham* "him", *henne* "her"
* demonstrative: *dette* "this"
* reflexive: *seg* "self"
* reciprocal: *hverandre* "eachother"
* interrogative: *hvem* "who", *hva* "what", *hvilken* "which"
* totality: *alle* "all"
* indefinite: *noen* "some"
* relative: *som* "that"
