### Definition

A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function, or both.

Many symbols are or contain special non-alphanumeric, non-standard logographic characters, similarly to punctuation. What makes them different from punctuation is that they can be substituted by normal words. This involves all currency symbols, _e.g. $75_ is identical to 七十五圓 / _qīshíwǔ yuán_ "seventy-five dollars".

Mathematical operators form another group of symbols.

Another group of symbols is emoticons and emoji.
