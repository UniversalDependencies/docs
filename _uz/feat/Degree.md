Degree of comparison is inflectional feature of some [adjectives](uk-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](uk-pos/ADV).
In Uzbek, adjectives and adverbs are in the zero form, or  It is formed by adding the suffixes _"-roq", "eng", "juda", "g‘oyat(baghayot)", "-gina, (-kina, -qina)", "-sh, -ish", "-mtir, -imtir", "-sal", "nim", "och", and "biroz"_. Their type is determined according to their presence in the sentence.

### <a name="Pos">`Pos`</a>: positive, first degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something, without comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this
degree is traditionally called "positive", negative properties can be compared, too.

#### Examples

* _<b>Qizil</b> olma_ “<b>Red</b> apple”
* _<b>Yosh</b> yigit_ “<b>Young</b> man”

### <a name="Cmp">`Cmp`</a>: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another object.

#### Examples

* _Chiroyliroq/go‘zalroq_ “prettier”
* _Chaqqonroq/tezroq_ “quicker/faster”
* _Bu yigit anavi yigitga qaraganda <b>yoshroq</b>_ “This man is <b>younger</b> than that one.”

### <a name="Sup">`Sup`</a>: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other objects within a set.

#### Examples
* <b>eng go‘zal</b> “the prettiest”
* <b>juda chaqqon</b> “the quickest/fastest”
* <b>eng yaxshi</b> “the best”
* Bu yigit jamoamizda <b>eng yoshi</b> “This is the <b>youngest</b> person in our team”
* ...

### <a name="Dim">`Dim`</a>: diminutive (Ozaytirma darajasi)

Morphologically derived form of a noun that indicates small size, or, metaphorically, affection towards the entity described by the noun. While nouns are the prototypical category in which diminutives are formed, the feature is not restricted to nouns and in some languages similar morphology can be observed with other categories (adjectives, verbs).
