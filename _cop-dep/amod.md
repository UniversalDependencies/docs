This function is reserved to the small closed class of Egyptian adjectives which may follow a noun without mediating ⲛ. The label is only given if the construction is actually noun+adjective: if an ⲛ appears, then the label should be `nmod`.

Example: 

~~~ sdparse
ⲟⲩ/DET ϣⲏⲣⲉ/NOUN ϣⲏⲙ/NOUN \n a little boy

amod(ϣⲏⲣⲉ, ϣⲏⲙ)
~~~

Note that such adjectives are still tagged with the POS tag N, following the Scriptorium POS tagging guidelines.
