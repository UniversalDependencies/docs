Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite verb forms.

### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* _Ти <b>навчаєшся</b> в університеті.&nbsp;_ “<b>You study</b> at the university.”

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the action of the verb.

Ukrainian verbs (except for modal verbs) have imperative forms of the second person singular, first person plural and second person plural.

#### Examples

* _<b>Навчайся</b> в університеті!&nbsp;_ “<b>Study</b>`Sing` at the university!”
* _<b>Навчайтеся</b> в університеті!&nbsp;_ “<b>Study</b>`Plur` at the university!”
* _<b>Навчаймося</b> в університеті!&nbsp;_ “Let us <b>study</b> at the university!”

### <a name="Cnd">`Cnd`</a>: conditional

The conditional mood is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen.

Ukrainian conditional is formed periphrastically using
the past participle of the content verb and a special form of the [auxiliary verb](uk-pos/AUX)
_б._

The past participle of the content verb is not marked as conditional
because it can also be used in past indicative.

#### Examples

* _Якби я був розумним, я <b>б</b> вчився в університеті.&nbsp;_ “If I were smart I <b>would</b> study at the
  university.”
