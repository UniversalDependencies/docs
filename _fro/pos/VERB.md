### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause.

The tag `VERB` is reserved for full lexical verbs, while auxiliary verbs are tagged `AUX`.
