Multiword numerals are marked as compound (153 ezer - 153 thousand): the last element is the head, and all the other elements are attached to the one to its right with the relation compound.

The relation compound:preverb holds between the preverb and its parent verb whenever they are spelt in two words (nem jött el - not come-PAST-3SG-INDEF away - "he did not come").
