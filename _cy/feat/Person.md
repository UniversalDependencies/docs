Person is a feature of personal and possessive pronouns and verbs. In verbs, this feature marks the subject, in some cases allowing the subject to be dropped entirely. 


### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person

The first person refers to the speaker; singular first person includes just one speaker, while plural first person includes many speakers, or groups the speaker with others. 

#### Examples

* _Canaf i_ "I will sing"
* _Rydw i'in gweithio_ "I am working"
* _Canson ni_ "We sang"
* _Roeddwn ni'n cerdded_ "We were running"

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person

The second person refers to the listener. The singular second person denotes just one listener, while the plural form denotes several listeners.

#### Examples

* _Cenaist ti_ "You(sing) sang"
* _Dewch chi_ "You(pl) will come"


### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons who are not present, i.e. neither speakers nor listeners.

#### Examples

* _Mae hi'n athrowes_ "she is a teacher"
* _Daethon nhw_ "they came"

### <a name="0">`0`</a>: impersonal form

The impersonal ver forms are employed when the subject is not present.
It is a form distinct from the 3rd person which is frequently translated using passive voice in English. It is nevertheless not a passive form, since the verb does not agree with any argument and there is no subject whatsoever

#### Examples

* _Gweler tudalen 20_ "[one] may see page 20"
