A clausal subject is a clausal syntactic subject of a clause, i.e.,
the subject is itself a clause. The governor of this relation might
not always be a verb: when the verb is a copular verb, the root of the
clause is the complement of the copular verb. In the following
example, *what she said* is the subject.

~~~ sdparse
What she said makes sense
csubj(makes, said)
