This is a binary (yes/no) morphological feature that is only annotated when its value is `Yes`.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: emphatic form of a word

This value is marked either for words which appear in an expanded, emphatic form with respect to a basic one, and that can be no longer analyzed as a [compound](la-feat/Compound) if it ever was one, or for (functional) words (usually labelled as [particles](la-pos/PART)) which serve the purpose of creating an emphatic expression in association with another (lexical) word (usually taking the deprel [advmod:emph](la-dep/advmod-emph) like focus particles, which are mostly labelled as [adverbs](la-pos/ADV)).

In Latin, strategies to mark emphasis are often specific to a given word subclass, like personal pronouns, and can sometimes be traced back to demonstrative/pronominal or interjective elements.


#### Examples

* ***enim*** is emphatic with respect to *nam*
* ***equidem*** is emphatic with respect to *quidem*
* ***ecce*** is a "presentative particle" in an emphatic form, also with a demonstrative *-ce* element 
    * in all these words, an *e-* element appears, which might be the same  
* ***namque*** is another emphatic form of *nam* showing the common *-que* suffix
* ***meopte*** shows an emphatic *-pte* suffix, which is added to possessives
* ***semet*** shows an emphatic *-met* suffix, added to personal pronouns (*egomet*, *tibimet*...), often treated as a [clitic](la-feat/Clitic)
* ***mehercle*** can possibly be seen as an emphatic form of the vocative of *Hercules* (*me-* might correspond to the first-person personal pronoun)
