### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [verbs](VERB) for such categories as time, place, direction or manner. In Italian, they may also modify [adjectives](ADJ) (as in _<b>palesemente</b> falso_ "clearly fake"), other adverbs (as in _<b>molto</b> bene_ "very well"), or even [nouns](NOUN) / [pronouns](PRON) (as in _<b>proprio</b> lui_ "exactly him").
		       
<!-- Since in traditional Italian grammars there is no clear consensus on the existence of _pronominal adverbs_ as an independent morpho-syntactic category, we decided to avoid using the `ADV` postag to deal with potential pronominal adverbs which are rather treated as [PRON]().-->
