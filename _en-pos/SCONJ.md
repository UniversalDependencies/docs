`SCONJ` is used for these three subclasses of subordinating conjunctions:

* Complementizers: _that_, _whether_, _if_, etc.
* Adverbial clause introducers: _when_, _since_, _before_, etc. (when introducing a clause not a nominal)
* Relativizers: Just _that_.  (Following Jespersen (1924) and the Penn Treebank, we analyze _that_ as a subordinating conjunction (complementizer) and not as a relative pronoun.)
