In English `Case` is only used for some personal [pronouns](en-pos/PRON). Pronouns can be either in the direct or oblique 
case.
 
### `Nom`: direct

The following pronouns are in the direct case:

* _I, you, he, she, it, we, they_
  

### `Acc`: oblique

The following pronouns are in the oblique case:

* _me, you, him, her, it, us, them_

Note that _you_ and _it_ can be either in the direct or oblique case. If they appear in subject 
position, they are marked as `Nom`, while if they appear in object position or if they have a prepositional
[case](en-dep/case) marker, they are marked as `Acc`.
