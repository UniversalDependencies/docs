#### Description

Verbs typically inflect for tense and mood. Verbs signal events and actions. Verbs can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause.

Welsh is a VSO language, thus the verb comes first.


There are four moods: indicative, imperative, conditional and subjunctive. Tenses include simple past, past habitual and future. Together with the auxiliary _bod_ and a prepositions/adjective many compound tenses can be formed

There is an impersonal verb form, which most closely correlates to the English passive. However it is not technically a passive form as the subject is "understood" and the nominal argument is an object 



##### Examples

* _Bwytdd o fara_ "he ate bread"
* _Canaf i_ "I will sing"
* _Rydw i'n bwyta bara_ "I am eating bread"
* _Rydw i wedi bwyta bara_ "I have eaten bread"
* _Rydw i wedi bod yn bwyta_ "I have been eating"
* _Rydw i newydd fwyta bara_ "I have just eaten bread"
* _Rydw i ar fwyta bara_ "I am just about to eat bread"
* _Roedd o'n bwyta_ "he was eating"
* _Bydd o'n bwyta_ "he will be eating"
