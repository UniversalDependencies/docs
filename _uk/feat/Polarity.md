In Ukrainian, negation is done using the particle _не_ which is most often written as a separate word. In some cases, depending on the part of speech and orthographical conventions, it becomes a bound morpheme, mostly with [adjectives](uk-pos/ADJ), [adverbs](uk-pos/ADV), and some deverbative [nouns](uk-pos/NOUN). Negation is usually unmarked. However, there are several exceptions for [verbs](uk-pos/VERB) (see examples below) where it is used. The affirmative variants, which are prevailing, are not marked for negation at all.

Note that `Negative=Neg` is not the same thing as [PronType]()`=Neg`. For pronouns and other pronominal parts of speech there is no such binary opposition as for verbs and adjectives. (There is no such thing as “affirmative pronoun”.) 

### Neg: negative

#### Examples

##### Short forms of some instantenious verbs

* _<b>нічичирк</b>&nbsp;_ the short verb form from _чичиркнути_ “not to produce a single sound”
* _<b>нітелень</b>&nbsp;_ the short verb form from _теленькнути_ “to be silent, not to speak”

##### Negative existentials

* _<b>немає</b>&nbsp;_ the negative impersonal verb form from _мати_ “there are no / there are not” (It is important to differentiate this form from a similar 3rd person finite verb negative expression _<b>не має</b>&nbsp;_ “(he/she/it) does not have”, where negation is expressed by an independent particle. Their meanings and syntactic behaviour differ.)
* _<b>чорт-мало</b>&nbsp;_ the negative impersonal verb form from _чортмати_ “there were no / there were not” (colloquial expression)
