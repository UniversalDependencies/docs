### Definition
An auxiliary verb is a verb that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, and voice.

French auxiliary verbs can be divided into tense, passive and causative auxiliaries

### Delimitation

At the opposite of the original Google annotation and the universal UD guidelines, French corpora don't use modal auxiliaries.
Verbs likes _savoir_, _pouvoir_, _devoir_, _vouloir_, _falloir_, _voir_, _aimer_, _souhaiter_ are considered as normal verbs.

French corpora has just three main auxiliary verb ([AUX]())

 - *être* (to be) is used as a copule, as a tense auxiliary and as a passive auxiliary,
 - *avoir* (to have) is used as a tense auxiliary,
 - *faire* (to make) is used in causative constructions.

There are a few other lemmas which can be annotated as ([AUX]()):
 - *voir* (to see) in the specific meaning of *se voir* (to be awarded)
   - ex: *il se voit décerner le grade de docteur en théologie.* (he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Theology.)
 - *refaire* (to make again) when it is used in a causative construction
   - ex: *on a mis du temps à le refaire revenir chez nous* (it took us a long time to get him back home)
