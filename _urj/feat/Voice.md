### Description

For most Uralic languages, voice means mainly the active-passive distinction.
Voice is a main feature of verb. The Uralic impersonal are marked as passive
voice and other forms as active. Infinite verb forms that are not clearly either
should not have a voice feature; for infinitives that do have distinct active
and passive voice it should be marked. The selection needs to be documented in
the language specific section.
