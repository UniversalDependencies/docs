### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [verbs](VERB) for such categories as time, place, direction or manner. They may also modify [adjectives](ADJ) (as in _<b>clarament</b> fals_ "clearly fake"), other adverbs (as in _<b>molt breument</b>_ "very briefly") or even [nouns](NOUN) / [pronouns](PRON) (as in _<b>solament</b> tu_ "only you").

There is a closed subclass of _pronominal adverbs_ that refer to circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly; similarly to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, relative, demonstrative, etc. To conform to the UD guidelines, pronominal adverbs also get the `ADV` part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional features (see [pronominal type](PronType)).

### Examples

- _molt_ "very"
- _bé_ "well"
- _exactament_ "exactly"
- _demà_ "tomorrow"
- _dalt, baix_ "up, down"
- interrogative or exclamative adverbs: _on, quan, com, per què_ "where, when, how, why
- demonstrative adverbs: _aquí, allí, ara, després_ "here, there, now, then"
- totality adverbs: _sempre_ "always"
- negative adverbs: _mai_ "never"
