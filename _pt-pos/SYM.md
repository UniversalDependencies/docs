`SYM` occurs with 2 features: [pt-feat/Gender]() (416; 100% instances), [pt-feat/Number]() (416; 100% instances)

`SYM` occurs with 3 feature-value pairs: `Gender=Masc`, `Number=Plur`, `Number=Sing`

`SYM` occurs with 2 feature combinations.
The most frequent feature combination is `Gender=Masc|Number=Plur` (408 tokens).
Examples: _%, US$, R$, CR$, $%, U$_
