### Definition

A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or
part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object.

In Danish proper nouns differ from common nouns in inflecting only for case, not for definiteness or number, as they are definite and singular by default.

### Examples

- _Anna_, _Otto_
- _Skåne_, _USA_
- _Texaco_, _Pirelli_
