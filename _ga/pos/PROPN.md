#### Description

A proper noun is a noun that is the name of a specific individual, place, object or organisation. In Irish, proper nouns always have initial capitalisation. 

Personal names are treated as a sequence of proper nouns. Note that some Irish names have name particles, such as _Mac_, _Ó_, _Ní_, etc., that form part of this sequence (e.g. _Anne-Marie Nic Dhonncha_). These particles are tagged as [PART]().

Similarly, placenames can occur as a string of proper nouns (e.g. _Baile Átha Cliath_ "Dublin"), as can organisations (e.g. _an iris <b>Irish Computer</b>_ "the Irish Computer magazine"). Sometimes these strings can have an internal structure containing other parts of speech such as determiners, for example (_Parlaimint na hEorpa_ "the European Parliament").
In the case of counties (Co. Chiarraí), _Co._ is tagged as X (abbreviation), and the county as PROPN.

When initial mutation occurs with proper nouns in Irish, the inflection is lowercase, while the main form retains the initial capitalisation (e.g. _i mBaile Átha Cliath_ "in Dublin"). Similarly, some titles can have lower-case prefixes (e.g. _an t-iar-Ghobharnóir_ "the former Governor").

Note that days of the week and months of the year in Irish, while capitialised, are not marked as proper nouns but common nouns instead.

Some abreviations are also marked as proper nouns.
