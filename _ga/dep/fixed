The `fixed` multi-word expression relation is one of the relations for compounding and it is intended mostly for function words.
The first token is the head of a fixed unit - with right branching attachments from the head to each element of the MWE.

Note that in Irish, `flat` and `flat-name` are used for nominal compounds - organisations, people etc. Regular noun compounds are labelled `compound`.
`compound:prt` is used for particle verbs e.g. 'éirí as'

The other multiword units in Irish that are labelled as fixed are as follows:
