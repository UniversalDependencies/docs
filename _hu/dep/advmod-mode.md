advmod:from – relation between an adverb answering for the question „from where?” and its parent

advmod:locy – relation between an adverb answering for the question „where?” and its parent

advmod:to – relation between an adverb answering for the question „where to?” and its parent

advmod:tfrom – relation between an adverb answering for the question „from when?” and its parent

advmod:tlocy – relation between an adverb answering for the question „when?” and its parent

advmod:tto – relation between an adverb answering for the question „till when or by when?” and its parent

advmod:mode – relation between other adverbs and their parents
