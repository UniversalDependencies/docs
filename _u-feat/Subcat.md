Lexical feature of verbs.
Some tagsets distinguish intransitive and transitive verbs.
In many languages however, subcategorization of verbs is much more complex than this.

### <a name="Intr">`Intr`</a>: intransitive verb

A verb that does not take arguments other than the subject.

#### Examples

* [en] _to <b>go</b>_

### <a name="Tran">`Tran`</a>: transitive verb

A verb that takes a direct (accusative) object as argument (in addition to the subject).
These verbs can be passivized, then the direct object becomes the subject.

#### Examples

* [en] _to <b>do</b> something, to be <b>done</b> by somebody_

### <a name="Ditr">`Ditr`</a>: ditransitive verb

A verb that takes two core objects as arguments (in addition to the subject).
These verbs can be passivized.

#### Examples

* [en] _to <b>give</b> somebody something, to be <b>given</b> something by somebody_
