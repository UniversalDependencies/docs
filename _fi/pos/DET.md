Determiners are words that modify [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases and
express the reference of the noun phrase in context.

Finnish has no true articles
(see e.g. [WALS](http://wals.info/valuesets/37A-fin)) and many
formalizations of Finnish morphology don't involve a determiner (or
related) tag. However, words such as _yksi_ "one" and _se_ "that"
are used similarly to articles, especially in spoken language.

#### Examples

* [fi] _yksi mies lähti_ "a/one man left"
* [fi] _se mies lähti_ "the/that man left"

#### References

* <http://scripta.kotus.fi/cgi-bin/visktermit/visktermit.cgi?h_id=aCHEBBEDH> (in Finnish)
