Degree of comparison is typically an inflectional feature of some
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](u-pos/ADV).

### `Pos`: positive, first degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something,
without comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this
degree is traditionally called "positive", negative properties can be
compared, too.

#### Examples

* _homem <b>jovem</b>_
* _<b>criança</b> esperta_

### `Cmp`: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object.

#### Examples

* _o homem é <b>melhor</b> que eu_
* _o homem é <b>mais</b> alto que eu_

### `Sup`: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set.

#### Examples

*  _ele é o <b>mais</b> alto do nosso grupo_

### `Abs`: absolute superlative

Some languages, as Portuguese, can express morphologically that the studied quality of
the given object is so strong that there is hardly any other object
exceeding it. The quality is not actually compared to any particular
set of objects.

#### Examples

* _lindo_ "handsome"; _<b>lindíssimo</b>_ "<b>indescribably
  handsome</b>"
