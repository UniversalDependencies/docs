This is a subtype of [aux](), used for the imperative auxiliary _давай_.

The imperative auxiliary, when attached to a predicate,
typically carries some of the tense/aspect/modality suffixes as well as person/number agreement suffixes.

Although they do not function as an auxiliary when attached to non-predicate words or phrases,
we use `aux:imp` for all forms and uses of the highly suppletive optative auxiliary paradigm and particles.
