### Definition

An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or
part of an exclamation. It typically expresses an emotional reaction,
is not syntactically related to other accompanying expressions, and
may include a combination of sounds not otherwise found in the
language.

As a special case of interjections, we recognize feedback particles
such as _ano_, _jo_, _ne_, etc.
Note that these words are considered particles in the PDT tagset
and have to be retagged during the conversion process.

### Examples

(Note that no direct translation of interjections is possible.
The approximate translations below are for orientation purposes and they
cannot serve to judge the part of speech from the English perspective.)

- _ach&nbsp;_ “oh”
- _pink&nbsp;_
- _inu&nbsp;_ “well”
- _hle&nbsp;_ “look”
- _proboha&nbsp;_ “for God's sake”

## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

At present the UD-conversion of PDT keeps the PDT convention on tagging
the response words (“yes, no”) as particles.
Automatic conversion would not be straightforward because the negative particle
_ne_ is sometimes used as the response particle/interjection (English “no”)
and sometimes as a free negative morpheme (English “not”).
These two usages would have to be distinguished and only the first one
converted to interjection.
