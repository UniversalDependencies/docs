The label obl:agent (agent modifier) is used for agents of passive verbs. Typically agents are animate, but there are inanimate agents, too, which are difficult to distinguish from instrumentals:

~~~ sdparse

    • toj so pláštašo at tri mestá - trimína čülǽkove 
          he was (being) paid from three places -  by three men
obl: agent (pláštašo, mestá)
conj (pláštašo, čülǽkove)
cc (pláštašo, - dush)
