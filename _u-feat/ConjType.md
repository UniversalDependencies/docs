We already distinguished the two main types, coordinating and
subordinating conjunctions, at the level of POS tags. However, there
are other (sub?)types that are not yet accounted for.

### Comp: comparing conjunction

Examples: [de] wie (as), als (than)

### Oper: mathematical operator

Note that operators can be expressed either using symbols or using
words.

Examples: [cs] krát (times), plus, minus
