The `aff` subrelation indicates the link between the head and its affix.
We annotate converbs affixes into [subordinating conjunction](pos/SCONJ), affixes of the verbal stem and we consider in our analysis that those verbal inflections act as a marker, which is the word marking a clause as subordinate to
another clause.
