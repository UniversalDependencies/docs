Valency is a language specific feauture for Bamana, as a transitivity of a verb matters for expression of perfective [aspect](pcm-feat/Aspect).

If a verb is transitive, an auxiliary is yé (negative equivalent tɛ́).

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: intransitive verb (1 argument)

#### Examples

* _Fàntá <b>yé</b> dɔ́nkili dá._ “Fanta sang.”

If a verb is intransitive, a suffix -ra is used. In the negation, there is still an auxiliary tɛ́.

* _Fàntá jɔ́<b>ra</b>._ “Fanta stood up.”
* _Fàntá <b>tɛ́</b> jɔ́._ “Fanta did not stand up.”

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: transitive verb (2 arguments)

#### Examples

* _O <b>ye</b> o dun._ “This has eaten this.”
