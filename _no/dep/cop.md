A copula is the relation between a non-verbal predicate and the copular verb *være* "to be".

~~~ sdparse
Det er ovnsbakt piggvar \n It is ovenbaked turbot
cop(piggvar, er)
~~~

Note that there are occurrences of *være* "to be" which do not give rise to a copula analysis, such as in cleft constructions (see [expl](expl)).
