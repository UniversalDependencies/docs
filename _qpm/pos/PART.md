## PART

### Definition


Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions 
of other universal parts of speech (e.g. [adpositions](ADP.md), [coordinating conjunctions](CCONJ.md), [subordinating conjunctions](SCONJ.md) 
or [auxiliary verbs](AUX_.md)).
Particles may encode grammatical categories such as negation, mood, tense etc.
Particles are normally not inflected, although exceptions may occur.
