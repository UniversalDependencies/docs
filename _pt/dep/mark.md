A marker is the word introducing a finite clause subordinate to
another clause. For a [complement clause](ccomp), this is words like  _que_
or _se._ For an [adverbial clause](advcl), the marker is typically a
[subordinating conjunction](../pos/SCONJ) like _enquanto_ or _embora._ The mark is a dependent of the
subordinate clause head. In a relative clause, it is a normally uninflected word, which simply introduces a relative clause, such as _que_. In this last use, one needs to distinguish between relative clause markers, which are `mark` from relative pronouns, which fill a regular verbal argument or modifier grammatical relation.

~~~ sdparse
Era de facto por ali que começava a surgir perigo
mark(surgir, que)
~~~

Note that this relation holds between the marker and the head of the subordinate clause, which can be a non verbal element.

~~~ sdparse
Sugere ainda que seja elaborada uma circular
mark(elaborada, que)
~~~
