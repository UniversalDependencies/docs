### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a subordinate clause.

Subordinating conjunctions in Cantonese include all markers of subordinate clauses, including conditional clauses, purpose clauses, etc.

In paired clauses where both clauses are marked by a conjunctive word and the first is subordinate to the second, we treat the conjunctive word in the first clause as `SCONJ`, whereas the one in the second, main clause as an adverb (<a>`ADV`</a>) (e.g., 雖然/SCONJ... 但係/ADV... / _seoi1jin4... daan6hai6..._ "Although... however...").

### Examples

- 如果 / _jyu4gwo2_ "if", 嘅話 / _ge3waa6_ "if"
- 雖然 / _seoi1jin4_ "although"
- 即管 / _zik1gwun2_ "even if"
- 無論 / _mou6leon3_ "no matter"
- 嚟 / _lei4_ "(in order) to"
  - 你 慳 <b>嚟</b> 做 乜 呀 ? / _nei5 haan1 <b>lei4</b> zou6 mat1 aa1_ "What are you being thrifty for? (lit. You save to do what?)"
