### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* [sv] _de <b>kompletterar</b> varandra_ "they complement each other"
* [sv] _vi <b>behöver</b>_ "we need"

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to perform the
action of the verb.

#### Examples

* [sv] _<b>låt</b> oss_ "let us"
* [sv] _<b>jämför</b> dem_ "compare them"

### <a name="Sub">`Sub`</a>: subjunctive / conjunctive

In modern Swedish the subjunctive is mainly used in certain fixed expressions and as a conditional form. It is also occassionally used in the more traditional sense, expressing actions that are subjective or otherwise uncertain in subordinate clauses.

#### Examples

* [sv] _<b>Leve</b> Sverige!_ "Long live Sweden!"
* [sv] _det <b>vore</b> önskvärt_ "it would be desirable"
* [sv] _som om jag vore försumlig_ "as if I were neglectful"
