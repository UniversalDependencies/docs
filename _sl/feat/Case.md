`Case` is an inflectional feature of [adjectives](ADJ), [determiners](DET), [nouns](NOUN), [numerals](NUM), [pronouns](PRON) and [proper nouns](PROPN), as well as a valency (lexical) feature of [adpositions](ADP).

Slovenian morphology distinguishes six cases:
`Nom`, `Gen`, `Dat`, `Acc`, `Loc` and `Ins`.

### `Nom`: nominative

The base form of the noun, also used as citation form (lemma). This is the word form usually used for subjects of clauses and answers the question _Kdo ali kaj (je)?_ "Who or what (is there)?".

* _<b>Država</b> je dala jamstva_. "The state has given guarantees."

### `Gen`: genitive

In addition to its prototypical meaning of a noun modifying another noun, genitive in Slovenian is used in certain syntactic positions, such as negation, or with certain prepositions. Word form in genetive answers the question _Koga ali česa (ni)?_ "Who or what (is not there)?"

* _prestolnica <b>države</b>_ "the country's capital"
* _Te <b>države</b> ni na zemljevidu._ "This country is not in the map."
* _brez <b>države</b>_ "without country", _iz <b>države</b>_ "from country"

### `Dat`: dative

This is the word form often used for indirect objects of verbs. It answers the question _Komu ali čemu (dam)?_ "To whom or what (do I give)?"

* _služiti svoji <b>državi</b>_ "to serve one's country"
* _proti <b>državi</b>_ "against country", _k <b>državi</b>_ "to country" 

### `Acc`: accusative

This is the word form most frequently used for direct objects of verbs. It answers the question _Koga ali kaj (vidim)?_ "Who or what (do I see)?"

* _napasti <b>državo</b>_ "to attack a country"
* _za <b>državo</b>_ "for country", _v <b>državo</b>_ "in/to country"  

### `Loc`: locative

The locative case often expresses location in space or time, but non-locational meanings also exist. The locative word form answers the question _O kom ali čem (govorim)?_ "Of whom or what (do I speak)?" and usually appears with a preposition.

* _v <b>državi</b>_ "in the country", _po <b>državi</b>_ "throughout the country", _o <b>državi</b>_ "about the country"

### `Ins`: instrumental

The instrumental case often expresses the instrument, means or accompaniment of an action, but other meanings also exist. The instrumental word form answers the question _S kom ali čim (delam)?_ "With whom or what (do I work)?"

* _z <b>državo</b>_ "ith country", _pred <b>državo</b>_ "before country", _nad <b>državo</b>_ "above country"
