The prohibitive expresses negative commands and combines the negation _lā_ with the present tense. Optionally, the particle _lū_ may be added to stress the command.

#### Examples
* _<b>lā tapaššiṭ</b>_ “do not erase”
* _<b>lā tunakkar</b>_ “do not remove”
* _<b>lū lā eṣṣidi</b>_ “may he not harvest”
