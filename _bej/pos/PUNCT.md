### Definition

Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used to delimit linguistic units in printed text.
We have punctuation tokens that mark breaks in the prosodic sequence, a single slash (/) indicates a minor boundary between two intonation units while a double slash (//) indicates a major prosodic break between two intonation units.
