### Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes. They may also function as predicates, as in

_El coche es <b>verde</b>._ "The car is green."

In Spanish, adjectives normally follow the noun, e.g. _La casa <b>amarilla</b>_ "The yellow house", although sometimes they may also precede the noun, e.g. _La <b>blanca</b> nieve_ "The white snow".

Adjectives in Spanish agree in number and gender with the noun they modify, e.g. _la casa <b>amarilla</b>_ (femenine singular), _las casas <b>amarillas</b>_ (femenine plural).

### Examples

* _grande_ "big"
* _viejo_ "old"
* _verde_ "green"
* _incomprensible_ “incomprehensible”
* _primero_ "first", _segundo_ "second", _tercero_ "third"

The class of adjectives in Spanish UD also includes _ordinal numbers_ and _participial adjectives_. Ordinal numbers can function in different contexts, as adverbs (ADV) when modifying a verb (VERB), as adjectives (ADJ) when modifying a noun (NOUN). Note that _participial adjectives_ are word forms that may share properties and usage of adjectives and verbs. Depending on context, they may be classified as either [VERB]() or ADJ. In the case of participial adjectives, the lemma is not the verb in the infinitive form, but rather the masculine singular form of the participle.

### For example:
* form: _<b>moderada</b>_; lemma: _moderado_ "moderated"
* form: _<b>organizadas</b>_; lemma: _organizado_ "organized"

To conform to the UD guidelines, possessive adjectives are handled as determiners [DET](). In Spanish, there are two types of possessive adjectives: unstressed (mi, tu, su, nuestro, vuestro) and stressed (mío, tuyo, suyo, nuestro, vuestro).These possessive adjectives agree in gender and number with the noun they modify and are treated as determiners within the UD framework.
