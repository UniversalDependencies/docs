The relation `obl` is used for nominals that constitute an adjunct as in the first example or a non-core (oblique)
argument as in the second example. Like in many Indo-European languages, oblique marking in German is not restricted
to prepositions; a bare noun phrase in a non-core case (dative, genitive) is oblique as well.

obl(hältst, Rede)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Wie kann ich Ihnen helfen ? \n How can I you.Dat help ?

Note that oblique dependents can also introduce relative clauses. In such cases, the relative pronoun itself is marked `obl`.

obl(wohne, dem)
