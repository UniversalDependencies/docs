# Working Groups for Guidelines

As discussed at the [brainstorming meeting in Pisa](http://universaldependencies.org/misc/brainstorming-pisa-09-18-2017.html) and elsewhere, we need to develop more detailed guidelines for many linguistic phenomena. We therefore want to create topical working groups that can collect examples from different languages, discuss how these examples can be analyzed in a way that is consistent with the universal guidelines as well as consistent across languages, and propose guidelines that can be incorporated in the documentation of the universal guidelines.
