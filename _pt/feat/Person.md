Person is typically feature of personal and possessive
[pronouns](u-pos/PRON) / [determiners](u-pos/DET), and of [verbs](u-pos/VERB). On verbs it is in
fact an agreement feature that marks the person of the verb's subject. Person
marked on verbs makes it unnecessary to always add a personal pronoun
as subject and thus subjects are sometimes dropped (pro-drop
languages).

### `1`: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons.

#### Examples

* _<b>eu</b>_, _<b>nós</b>_
* <b>quero</b>, <b>queremos</b>

### `2`: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the
utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and
optionally some third persons too.

#### Examples

* _<b>tu, você, vós, vocês</b>_
* _<b>queres, quereis</b>_ 

### `3`: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither
speakers nor addressees.

#### Examples

* _<b>ele, ela, eles, elas</b>_
* _<b>quer, querem</b>_
