A Yupik nominal or quantifier-qualifier construction may inflect for third person reflexive (also known as fourth person) to refer to the subject of its clause.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is reflexive

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not reflexive, the
`Reflex` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT`
column. (Which means that empty value has the `No` meaning.)

#### Examples

* [ess] _Taghnughhaq qinuyulghii iitghumaaq <b>apami</b> mangteghaanun._ "The sick child went into <b>his grandfather's</b> house." The nominal with the third person singular reflexive inflection _apa-mi_ `Number[psor]=Sing|Person[psor]=3|Reflex=Yes` refers to the third person singular subject _taghnughhaq_ "the child".

* [ess] _Naaka kakiiq <b>ellnginaghmi</b>._ "My mother sewed <b>alone</b>." The quantifier-qualifier construction _ellnginagh-mi_ "alone" inflects for third person singular reflexive `Number=Sing|Person=3|Reflex=Yes` to refer to the third person singular subject _naaka_ "my mother".
