A dependency is labeled as <code>dep</code> when a system is unable to determine a more precise dependency relation between two words. This may be because of a weird grammatical construction, a limitation in software, a parser error, or because of an unresolved long distance dependency. This is also the case of "broken" sentences like the one below.
