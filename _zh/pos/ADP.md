### Definition

The Chinese `ADP` covers three categories of function words analyzed as adpositions: (1) "coverbs"/prepositions, (2) valence markers, and (3) "localizers"/postpositions.

Chinese coverbs introduce an extra participant/argument to the event/main verb in a clause (but note that many coverbs may also function as main verbs).

- 他 <b>對</b> 我 做 了 很 殘忍 的 事情 ／ _tā <b>duì</b> wǒ zuò le hěn cánrěn de shìqíng_ "He did some cruel things to me."

Valence markers such as the "disposal" 把 / _bǎ_ and the "long passive" 被 / _bèi_ (when followed by an agent noun) are also tagged `ADP` (however, the "short passive" 被 / _bèi_ when not followed by a noun should be tagged <a>`AUX`</a>).

- 你 <b>把</b> 它 吃 掉 吧 / _nǐ <b>bǎ</b> tā chī diào ba_ "You should eat it up."
- 我 <b>被</b> 他 打 了 一 頓 / _wǒ <b>bèi</b> tā dǎle yī dùn_ "I was given a beating by him."

Localizers (also known as 方位詞 / _fāngwèicí_) serving as postpositions, typically indicate spatial information in relation to the noun preceding it. Some localizers have also grammaticalized into clausal markers indicating temporal information. Localizers with the clausal function are still tagged as `ADP` (but are labeled with the dependency relation <a>`mark`</a>).  Note that when localizers are serving as a sentence constituent, like [obj]() and [obl](), they should be tagged as [NOUN]().

- 我 把 梨子 放 在 桌子 <b>上</b> / _wǒ bǎ lízi fàng zài zhuōzi <b>shàng</b>_ "I'm putting the pears on the table."
- 他 妻子 死 了 <b>之後</b> ， 他 也 不 想 活 了 / _tā qīzi sǐ le <b>zhīhòu</b>, tā yě bùxiǎng huó le_ "After his wife died, he no longer wants to live either."
