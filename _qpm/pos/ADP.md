## ADP

### Definition

Adposition in Pomak is a preposition.
Thus, the preposition comes before a complement composed of a noun phrase, noun, pronoun, or clause that functions as a noun phrase, and 
forms a single structure with the complement to express its grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.

#### Examples

- *faf* / *f* "in", *kaná nósiš faf čántoto?* "what are you carrying in the bag?"
- *nah* "to, towards", *kóštana glǿda nah íznikane* "the house faces to the East"
- *pri* "near", *pri pótene íma annók gulǽma vríse* "near the street there is a big fount"
- *prez* "without", *mlózi astánaho prez rábato* "many are left without job" - "many people have been left without a job" 
- *ad* / *at* "from", *at sélono da itám je dve kilométry* "from the village to there it is two kilometers distance" [lit."from the village up to that point it is two kilometers"]
- *za* "for", *isazí je za tébe* "this here is for you"
- *da* "until", *vremǿso še je parátiko da drúgono haftó* - "the wather will be bad until next weak" [lit. "the weather will be bad until the next weak"] 
- *u* "to", *sedí sí u tæh i na hódi ní kadé*  "he stays at their place and he does not go anywhere"-[lit. "he sits at them and he goes nowhere"]
- *pad* / *pat* "under", *sǿnnahme pad annók górma da pačínneme na sénko* "we sat under a tree to rest at shade" 

However, there are some (very few) fixed expressions that are loans from the Turkish language, where ADPs occur as postpositions: 
- *tómu hatýr <b>ičín</b>* "for his sake"
