### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions
by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating
conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the
status of a (subordinate) clause.

We follow [Loos et al. 2003](http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsASubordinatingConjunctio.htm) in recognizing these three subclasses as subordinating conjunctions:

* Complementizers, like [en] _that_ or _if_
* Adverbial clause introducers, like [en] _when_, _since_, or _before_ (when introducing a clause not a nominal)
* Relativizers, like [he] _še_. (Note that these words, which simply introduce a relative caluse, and normally don't inflect, need to be distinguished from relative or resumptive pronouns, which have a nominal function within the relative clause and which we analyze as [PRON]().)

For _coordinating conjunctions,_ see [CCONJ]().

### Examples

- _that_ as in _I believe <b>that</b> he will come._
- _if_
- _while_
