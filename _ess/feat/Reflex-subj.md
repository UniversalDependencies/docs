A Yupik verb may be reflexive and refer to the subject of its main clause as its subject.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is reflexive

Note that there is no `No` value. If a verb is not reflexive, the
`Reflex[subj]` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT`
column. (Which means that empty value has the `No` meaning.)

#### Examples

* [ess] _Taghnughhaq qapragllequq <b>aqumgamakuni</b>._ "The child will move around <b>if he will remain sitting</b>." The verb ending _-uni_ in _aqumgamakuni_ encodes third person singular reflexive as its subject `Number[subj]=Sing|Person[subj]=3|Reflex[subj]=Yes` to refer to the subject of the main clause _taghnughhaq_ "the child" as its subject.
