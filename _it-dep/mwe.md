The multi-word expression (modifier) relation is one of the three relations (<code>compound</code>, <code>mwe</code>, <code>name</code>) for compounding. It is used for certain fixed grammaticized expressions that behave like function words or short adverbials. Any grammatical class can be part of a multiword expression, but the most common are realised as a combination of adverbs and prepositions (usually *a* or *di*).
Some of the most common mwe for Italian are listed in the examples.
