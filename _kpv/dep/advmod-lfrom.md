The _advmod:lfrom_ relation is used for adverbal modifiers with locative from, i.e. direction from source modality.
This is distinguished from other locative dependency relations advmod:lmod, advmod:lto and advmod:lmp,
which generally indicate locative, source and path, respectively, see also `obl:lfrom`.
