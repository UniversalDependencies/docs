Boolean feature of personal and adverbial [pronouns](pcm-pos/PRON).  It indicates
whether the word is possessive.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is possessive

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not possessive, the
`Poss` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT` column.

#### Examples

* _I don tire <b>ma</b> sister_ "my sister, I am tired"
* _<b>dem</b> roof e just dey dere_ "their roofs, they are just there"
