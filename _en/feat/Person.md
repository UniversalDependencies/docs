In English, `Person` is a feature of personal and possessive [pronouns](en-pos/PRON), and of some [verbs](en-pos/VERB) to mark agreement with its subject.

### `1`: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional persons. 

This feature is only used for pronouns and two inflections of _be_:

* _am, was_ (if _I_ is its subject)_, I, we, me, us, my, mine, our, ours, myself, ourselves_

### `2`: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and optionally some third persons too.

This feature is only used for pronouns:

* _you, your, yours, yourself, yourselves_

### `3`: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither speakers nor addressees.

It is used for the following pronouns:

* _he, she, it, they, him, her, them, his, hers, their, theirs, himself, herself, itself, themselves_

Additionally, it is used for verbs that require a third person singular subject which have the PTB tag `VBZ`.

####Examples:

* _he <b>walks</b>_
* _she <b>is</b>_
