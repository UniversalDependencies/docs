Degree of comparison is inflectional feature of some [adjectives](uk-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](uk-pos/ADV).

### `Pos`: positive, first degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something, without comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this
degree is traditionally called "positive", negative properties can be compared, too.

#### Examples

* _<b>молода</b> людина&nbsp;_ “<b>young</b> person”

### `Cmp`: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another object.

#### Examples

* _Цей чоловік <b>молодший</b>, ніж тамтой.&nbsp;_ “This man is <b>younger</b> than that one.”

### `Sup`: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other objects within a set.

#### Examples

* _Це <b>наймолодша</b> людина в нашій команді.&nbsp;_ “This is the <b>youngest</b> person in our team”


### `Abs`: absolute superlative

The quality of the given object is so strong that there is hardly any other object exceeding it. The quality is not actually compared to any particular set of objects but rather to the abilities of its carriers. In Ukrainian this degree is most often used with adverbs.

#### Examples

* _якнайвище_, _щонайкраще_ "very high", "the best possible / as good as one can"
