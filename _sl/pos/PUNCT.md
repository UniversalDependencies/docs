#### Conversion from JOS

The list of characters in ssj500k treebank has been manually divided into subgroups of `PUNCT` and [SYM](SYM). Note that some characters display characteristics of both POS categories, such as asterisk or dash-like characters that can either function as mathematical operators (`SYM`) or bullets in itemized lists (`PUNCT`). In case of such ambiguity, the more common function was chosen.
