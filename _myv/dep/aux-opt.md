This is a subtype of [aux](), used for the optative auxiliary _кадык_.

The optative auxiliary, when attached to a predicate,
typically carries some of the tense/aspect/modality suffixes as well as person/number agreement suffixes.

Although they do not function as an auxiliary when attached to non-predicate words or phrases,
we use `aux:opt` for all forms and uses of the highly suppletive optative auxiliary paradigm and particles.
