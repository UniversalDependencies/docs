This is used for interjections and other discourse particles and elements (which are not clearly linked to the structure of the sentence, except in an expressive way). We generally follow the guidelines of what the Penn Treebanks count as an INTJ.  They define this to include: interjections (*oh*, *uh-huh*, *Welcome*), fillers (*um*, *ah*), and discourse markers (*well*, *like*, *actually*, but not *you know*).
