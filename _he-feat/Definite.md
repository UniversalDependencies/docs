In Hebrew, `Definite` is reserved for marking [adjectives](he-pos/ADJ), [determiners](he-pos/DET), [nouns](he-pos/NOUN), [numbers](he-pos/NUM) and certain [verbs](he-pos/VERB) receiving definiteness by the construction known as `Construct state` or `סמיכות` (lit. "adjacency").

### `Red`

A word "attached" in a construct state to the following [noun](he-pos/NOUN) (or [proper noun](he-pos/PROPN)), creating a compound noun phrase. The word's original form may or may not have been altered.

#### Examples:

* _<b>אנשי</b> אשכולות_ (altered from original _אנשים_)
