Yupik verbs are either intransitive or transitive.

### <a name="Intr">`Intr`</a>: intransitive verb

A verb that does not take arguments other than the subject.

#### Examples

* [ess] _Afsengaq <b>neghtuq</b> pagunghaghmeng._ "A mouse ate crowberries." The inflection _-tu-_ `Subcat=Intr` in the verb indicates that it is an intransitive verb.


### <a name="Tran">`Tran`</a>: transitive verb

A verb that takes a direct (accusative) object as argument (in addition to the subject).

#### Examples

* [ess] _Kaamgek <b>iflaak</b>._ "He/she <b>lost</b> the boots." The inflection _-a-_ `Subcat=Tran` in the verb indicates that it is a transitive verb.
