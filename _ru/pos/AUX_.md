### Definition

The only truly auxiliary verb in Russian is _быть_ “to be”.
It accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses
grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb.

### Examples

- Future tense. Finite future form of _быть_ is combined with infinitive
  of the lexical verb. The auxiliary expresses person, number and tense:
  _<b>буду</b> делать_ “I will do”,
  _<b>будешь</b> делать_ “you will do”,
  _<b>будут</b> делать_ “they will do”.
  Note that a limited set of verbs can form future morphologically, without
  the auxiliary.

- Conditional mood.
  Conditional form (historically aorist) of _být_ is combined with past participle
  of the lexical verb. The auxiliary expresses person and number,
  the participle expresses gender and number:
  _сделал <b>бы</b>_ “I would do.`Masc`”,
  _сделала <b>бы</b>_ “I would do.`Fem`”,
  _сделали <b>бы</b>_ “we would do.`Masc`”.

- Passive voice.
  A form of _быть_ (in various tenses and moods or in the infinitive) is combined with
  passive participle
  of the lexical verb. The auxiliary expresses person, number, tense(past and future) and mood,
  the participle expresses gender, number and voice:
  _<b>будет</b> сделан_ “he will be done”,
  _<b>был</b> сделан_ “he was done”,
  _<b>был бы</b> сделан_ “he would be done”,

### Modal verbs are not auxiliaries

Russian modal verbs are not considered auxiliary and they are tagged `VERB`.
Their behavior is only slightly different from other content verbs.
