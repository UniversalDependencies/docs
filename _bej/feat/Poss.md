Boolean feature of pronouns.  It tells whether the word is possessive.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is possessive

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not possessive, the
`Poss` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT` column. (Which
means that empty value has the `No` meaning.)

#### Examples
- _kaːm <b>=i</b>_ "<my> camel"
