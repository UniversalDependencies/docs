Degree is a feature of adjectives that describe the quality of a noun.

### `Pos` : positive, first degree

States the quality of an object without comparing that quality to those of any other object.

#### Examples

* _ag airneál go <b>minic</b>_ "visiting (at night) <b>often</b>"


### `Cmp` : comparative, second degree

### `Sup` : superlative, third degree

In Irish, the comparative and the superlative form is the same. In both cases, the adjective is given a suffix, usually resembling the feminine genitive ending. Both the comparative and the superlative require a degree particle. For the comparative degree, this is _níos_ which corresponds to the English "more". The particle _is_ (loosely translated as "the most") is used to indicate the superlative degree.

#### Examples

* _<b>níos</b> fada_ "longer"
* _<b>níos</b> mó_ "bigger"

* _<b>is</b> fearr_ "the best"
* _<b>is</b> mó_ "the biggest"
