### Definition

Particles are uninflected words, and they are not further analyzed into morphemes. Many Yupik particles are borrowed from Chukchi, a geographically neighboring language, and are mostly adverbial or connective in meaning (de Reuse, 1994, p. 14).

### Examples
- _ighivgaq_ "yesterday"
- _qayughllak_ "because"
- _unaami_ "tomorrow"
