#####Definition
Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech.

For Norwegian, `PART` is used only for the infinitival marker *å* "to".

#####Examples
* _Han liker <b>å</b> spise is_ "He likes to eat icecream"
