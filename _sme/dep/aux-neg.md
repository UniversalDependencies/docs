This is a subtype of [aux](), used for the negative auxiliaries and particles _ij_.

The negative auxiliary, when attached to a predicate,
typically carries some of the tense/aspect/modality suffixes as well as person/number agreement suffixes.

Although they do not function as an auxiliary when attached to non-predicate words or phrases,
we use `aux:neg` for all forms and uses of the negative auxiliary paradigm and particles.
