Boolean feature of particle.  It tells whether the noun is a singulative.


### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is singulative

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not singulative, the
`Singulative` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT` column. (Which
means that empty value has the `No` meaning.)

#### Examples
- _ʤantaːji_ "djinn"
