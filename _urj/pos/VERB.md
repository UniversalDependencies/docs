### Description

Verbs in Uralic follow the universal guidelines. The attention needs to be paid
to an abundance of deverbal forms, often named infinitives and participles. They
will usually not directly 1:1 match the universal features. It is highly
recommended to match at least one infinitive to [VerbForm=Inf]() and participle
forms for [VerbForm=Part]() with [Tense=Past]() and [Tense=Pres](), the other
deverbal forms should be matched to their universal VerbForm equivalents if
possible. The Deverbal verb forms should in any case include the analyses of
cases etc. where they are present so a number of distinctions are retained and
when required, the traditional grammar can be retained in the XPOS and MISC
fields.

#### Examples

* [fi] _juosta_ "run"
* [fi] _ei_ "no", _en_ "I do not", _älkää_ "you must not"
* [fi] _syönyt_ "eaten", _olin <b>syömässä</b>_ "I was <b>eating</b>",
  _<b>syövä</b> mies_ "<b>eating</b> man"
