Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite verb forms. It allows for a speaker to express their attitude towards what they are saying.

### `Ind` : indicative mood

The indicative mood can be considered the default form of a verb. A verb in the indicative indicates something that has happened, is happening or will happen. 

#### Examples

* _Deirim_ "I say"
* _Thug sé_ "He gave"
* _Caithfidh mé_ "I will have to"

### `Cnd` : conditional mood

The conditional mood is used to express actions that are hypothetical. In Irish, the conditional is expressed in two different verb endings; these endings begin with the suffix _<b>-f-</b>_ or _<b>-ó-</b>_. In all but the 3rd person singular and the 2nd person plural, the verb endings are synthetic and do not require a subject pronoun. Conditional clauses are often introduced using <b>go</b> or <b>dá</b>.

#### Examples

* _Ól<b>fadh</b> sé_ "He would drink"
* _Dá bhfeic<b>feá</b>_ "If you saw"
* _...go bhfeic<b>feadh</b> sé_ "...that he would see"

### `Imp` : imperative mood

The imperative mood is used to give a command, express advice, or make a request. 

####  Examples

* _<b>Ná habair</b> liom_ "Don't tell me"
* _<b>Bígí</b> ar ais anseo_ "Be back here"
* _<b>Chuiridís</b> oilithrigh amach_ "Let them send the pilgrims out"

### `Sub` : subjunctive mood

In Irish, the subjunctive mood is used to express a wish or an uncertainty. It is normally formed with the particle <b>go</b> (positive) or <b>nár</b> (negative) followed by the verb in the subjunctive form. <b>Sula</b> 'before' is sometimes also used. The subjunctive is not widely used in Irish.

#### Examples

* _Go <b>n-imí</b> an diabhal do bhóthar_ "<b>May</b> the devil <b>be gone</b> from your way"
* _Go <b>raibh</b> maith agat_ "Thank you (lit. That you would have good)"
