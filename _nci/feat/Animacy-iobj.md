## Animacy[iobj]

In Nahuatl, the subject, object, and (for ditransitive verbs) indirect object 
can all have corresponding animacy and person and number agreement morphology on the verb.

* `Animacy[iobj]` is the animacy of the indirect object for bitransitive verbs.

For Verbs, we always use the layered Animacy features. For Nouns and Adjectives, which can be in the Singular or Plural, we use the Animacy feature.
