Case is an inflectional feature of [nouns](cs-pos/NOUN) and
other parts of speech ([adjectives](cs-pos/ADJ),
[numerals](cs-pos/NUM)) that mark agreement with nouns.
It is also valency feature of [prepositions](cs-pos/ADP) (saying that
the preposition requires its argument to be in that case).

Case helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence.
For example, the nominative
and accusative cases often distinguish subject and object of the verb,
while in fixed-word-order languages these functions would be
distinguished merely by the positions of the nouns in the sentence.

Czech morphology distinguishes seven cases:
`Nom`, `Gen`, `Dat`, `Acc`, `Voc`, `Loc` and `Ins`
(this ordering is fixed in the grammar and the cases are also referred to by numbers 1–7).

#### Examples

* singular nominative _matka&nbsp;_ “mother”, genitive _matky&nbsp;,_ dative _matce,&nbsp;_
  accusative _matku,&nbsp;_ vocative _matko,&nbsp;_ locative _matce,&nbsp;_ instrumental _matkou_
* plural nominative _matky,&nbsp;_ genitive _matek,&nbsp;_ dative _matkám,&nbsp;_
  accusative _matky,&nbsp;_ vocative _matky,&nbsp;_ locative _matkách,&nbsp;_ instrumental _matkami_

The descriptions of the individual case values below include semantic
hints about the prototypical meaning of the case. Bear in mind that
quite often a case will be used for a meaning that is totally
unrelated to the meaning mentioned here. Valency of verbs,
adpositions and other words will determine that the noun phrase must
be in a particular grammatical case to fill a particular valency slot
(semantic role).

### <a name="Nom">`Nom`</a>: nominative

The base form of the noun, also used as citation form (lemma).
This is the word form used for subjects of clauses.

#### Examples

* _<b>Jan</b> spí._ “<b>Jan</b> sleeps.”
* _<b>Jan</b> miluje Marii. “<b>Jan</b> loves Marie.”

### <a name="Gen">`Gen`</a>: genitive

Prototypical meaning of genitive is that the noun phrase somehow
belongs to its governor; it would often be translated by the English
preposition _of._

Note that despite considerable semantic overlap, the genitive case is
not the same as the feature of possessivity ([Poss]()). Possessivity
is a lexical feature, i.e. it applies to lemma and its whole
paradigm. Genitive is a feature of just a subset of word forms of the
lemma. Semantics of possessivity is much more clearly defined while
the genitive (as many other cases) may be required in situations that
have nothing to do with possessing. For example, _bez
prezidentovy dcery&nbsp;_ “without the president's daughter” is a
prepositional phrase containing the preposition _bez&nbsp;_ “without”, the
possessive adjective _prezidentovy&nbsp;_ “president's” and the noun _dcery&nbsp;_
“daughter”. The possessive adjective is derived from the noun
_prezident&nbsp;_ but it is really an adjective (with separate lemma and
paradigm), not just a form of the noun. In addition, both the
adjective and the noun are in their genitive forms (the nominative
would be _prezidentova dcera_).  There is nothing possessive about
this particular occurrence of the genitive. It is there because the
preposition _bez&nbsp;_ always requires its argument to be in genitive.

#### Examples

* _Praha je hlavní město <b>České republiky</b>.&nbsp;_ “Prague is the
  capital <b>of the Czech Republic</b>.”

### <a name="Dat">`Dat`</a>: dative

This is the word form often used for indirect objects of verbs.

#### Examples

* _Dal jsem dárek <b>svému bratrovi</b>.&nbsp;_ “I gave my brother a present.”
  (_svému bratrovi&nbsp;_ “my brother” is dative and
  _dárek&nbsp;_ “present” is accusative.)

### <a name="Acc">`Acc`</a>: accusative

Perhaps the second most widely spread morphological case.
This is the word form most frequently used for direct objects of verbs.

#### Examples

* _Jan miluje <b>Marii</b>. “Jan loves <b>Marie</b>.”

### <a name="Voc">`Voc`</a>: vocative

The vocative case is a special form of noun used to address
someone. Thus it predominantly appears with animate nouns (see the
feature of [Animacy]()). Nevertheless this is not a grammatical
restriction and inanimate things can be addressed as well.

#### Examples

* _Co myslíš, <b>Filipe</b>?&nbsp;_ “What do you think,
  <b>Filip</b>?”

### <a name="Loc">`Loc`</a>: locative

The locative case often expresses location in space or time, which
gave it its name. As elsewhere, non-locational meanings also exist and
they are not rare. On the other hand, some location roles
may be expressed using other cases (e.g. because those cases are
required by a preposition).

This is the only Czech case that is used exclusively in
combination with prepositions.

#### Examples

* _V <b>červenci</b> jsem byl ve <b>Švédsku</b>.&nbsp;_ “In <b>July</b>
  I was in <b>Sweden</b>.”
* _Mluvili jsme tam o <b>morfologii</b>.&nbsp;_ “We talked there about
  <b>morphology</b>.” (Non-locational non-temporal example)

### <a name="Ins">`Ins`</a>: instrumental

The role from which the name of the instrumental case is derived is
that the noun is used as instrument to do something (as in _psát
<b>perem</b>&nbsp;_ “to write <b>using a pen</b>”).  Many other meanings are
possible, for example the instrumental is required by the
preposition _s&nbsp;_ “with” and thus it includes the meaning expressed in
other languages by the comitative case.

In Czech the instrumental is also used for the agent-object in passive
constructions (cf. the English preposition _by_).

#### Examples

* _Tento zákon byl schválen <b>vládou</b>.&nbsp;_ “This bill has been
  approved <b>by the government</b>.” (Passive example)
