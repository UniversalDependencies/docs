<h2><code>Animacy</code>: animacy</h2>

<p>Similarly to <a href="">Gender</a> (and to the African noun classes), animacy is
usually a lexical feature of <a href="u-pos/NOUN">nouns</a> and inflectional
feature of other parts of speech that mark agreement with nouns. It is
independent of gender, therefore it is encoded separately in some
tagsets (e.g. all the Multext-East tagsets). On the other hand, in
Czech the (almost) only grammatical implications occur within the
masculine gender, which is why the PDT tagset does not have
animateness as separate feature and instead defines four genders:
masculine animate, masculine inanimate, feminine and neuter.  We
follow the two-feature approach used in Multext-East (many languages)
because it is safer.</p>

<p>Polish is special in that it also distinguishes grammatically human
vs. non-human animates. It can be demonstrated by inflection of the
example word <em>który</em> “which” (boldface forms differ from the middle
row):</p>

<h3 id="anim-animate"><code>Anim</code>: animate</h3>

<p>Human beings, animals, fictional characters, names of professions
etc. are all animate. Even nouns that are normally inanimate can be
inflected as animate if they are personified. For instance, consider a
children’s story about cars where cars live and talk as people; then
the cars may become and be inflected as animates.</p>

<h3 id="nhum-animate-but-non-human"><code>Nhum</code>: animate but non-human</h3>

<p>Attested in Polish. In languages where Nhum is used, <code>Anim</code> is
restricted to human beings (complement of <code>Nhum</code>).</p>

<h3 id="inan-inanimate"><code>Inan</code>: inanimate</h3>

<p>Nouns that are not animate are inanimate. (If <code>Nhum</code> is used, nouns
that are neither <code>Anim</code> nor <code>Nhum</code> are <code>Inan</code>.)</p>

<p><a id="al-u-feat/Aspect" class="al-dest"></a></p>
<h2><code>Aspect</code>: aspect</h2>

<p>Aspect is a feature that specifies duration of the action in time,
whether the action has been completed etc. In some languages
(e.g. English), some <a href="Tense">tenses</a> are actually combinations of
tense and aspect. In other languages (e.g. Czech), aspect and tense
are separate, although not completely independent of each other.</p>

<p>In Czech and other Slavic languages, aspect is a lexical feature.
Pairs of imperfective and perfective verbs exist and are often
morphologically related but the space is highly irregular and the
verbs are considered to belong to separate lemmas.</p>

<p>Since we proceed bottom-up, the current standard covers only a few
aspect values found in corpora.  See Wikipedia
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect</a>) for a long list of
other possible aspects.</p>

<h3 id="imp-imperfect-aspect"><code>Imp</code>: imperfect aspect</h3>

<p>The action took / takes / will take some time span and there is no
information whether and when it was / will be completed.</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em>péci</em> “to bake” (Imp); <em><b>pekl</b> chleba</em> “he baked / was
baking a bread”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="perf-perfect-aspect"><code>Perf</code>: perfect aspect</h3>

<p>The action has been / will have been completed. Since there is
emphasis on one point on the time scale (the point of completion),
this aspect does not work well with the present tense. For example,
Czech morphology can create present forms of perfective verbs but
these actually have a future meaning.</p>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em>upéci</em> “to bake” (Perf); <em><b>upekl</b> chleba</em> “he baked / has
baked a bread”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pro-prospective-aspect"><code>Pro</code>: prospective aspect</h3>

<p>Used in Basque. A combination of tense and aspect that indicates the
action is in preparation to take place.</p>

<h3 id="prog-progressive-aspect"><code>Prog</code>: progressive aspect</h3>

<p>English progressive tenses (<em>I am eating, I have been doing …</em>)
have this aspect. They are constructed analytically (auxiliary +
present participle) but the <em>-ing</em> participle is so bound to
progressive meaning that it seems a good idea to annotate it with this
feature (we have to distinguish it from the past participle somehow;
we may use both the “Tense” and the “Aspect” features).</p>

<p>In languages other than English, the progressive meaning may be
expressed by morphemes bound to the main verb, which makes this value
even more justified. Example is Turkish.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/universaldependencies/docs/edit/pages-source/_u-feat/Aspect.md" target="#">edit Aspect</a></p>

<p><a id="al-u-feat/Case" class="al-dest"></a></p>
<h2><code>Case</code>: case</h2>

<p>Case is usually an inflectional feature of <a href="u-pos/NOUN">nouns</a> and,
depending on language, other parts of speech (<a href="u-pos/ADJ">adjectives</a>,
<a href="u-pos/NUM">numerals</a>) that mark agreement with nouns. In some tagsets
it is also valency feature of <a href="u-pos/ADP">adpositions</a> (saying that
the adposition requires its argument to be in that case).</p>

<p>Case helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence,
especially in free-word-order languages. For example, the nominative
and accusative cases often distinguish subject and object of the verb,
while in fixed-word-order languages these functions would be
distinguished merely by the positions of the nouns in the sentence.</p>

<p>Here on the level of morphosyntactic features we are dealing with case
expressed morphologically, i.e. by bound morphemes (affixes). Note
that on a higher level case can be understood more broadly as <em>the
role,</em> and it can be also expressed by adding an adposition to the
noun. What is expressed by affixes in one language can be expressed
using adpositions in another language. Cf. the <a href="">u-dep/case</a>
dependency label.</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] nominative <em>matka</em> “mother”, genitive <em>matky</em>, dative <em>matce</em>,
accusative <em>matku</em>, vocative <em>matko</em>, locative <em>matce</em>,
 instrumental <em>matkou</em></li>
  <li>[de] nominative <em>der Mann</em> “the man”, genitive <em>des Mannes</em>,
dative <em>dem Mann</em>, accusative <em>den Mann</em></li>
  <li>[en] nominative/direct case <em>he, she</em>,
accusative/oblique case <em>him, her.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The descriptions of the individual case values below include semantic
hints about the prototypical meaning of the case. Bear in mind that
quite often a case will be used for a meaning that is totally
unrelated to the meaning mentioned here.  Valency of verbs,
adpositions and other words will determine that the noun phrase must
be in a particular grammatical case to fill a particular valency slot
(semantic role). It is much the same as trying to explain the meaning
of prepositions: most people would agree that the central meaning of
English <em>in</em> is location in space or time but there are phrases where
the meaning is less locational: <em>In God we trust.</em> <em>Say it in
English.</em></p>

<p>Note that Indian corpora based on the so-called Paninian model use a
related feature called <em>vibhakti</em>.  It is a merger of the Case feature
described here and of various postpositions. Values of the feature are
language-dependent because they are copies of the relevant morphemes
(either bound morphemes or postpositions). Vibhakti can be mapped on
the Case values described here if we know 1. which source values are
bound morphemes (postpositions are separate nodes for us) and 2. what
is their meaning. For instance, the genitive case (<code>Gen</code>) in Bengali
is marked using the suffix <em>-ra</em> (-র), i.e. vib=era.  In Hindi, the
suffix has been split off the noun and it is now written as a separate
word – the postposition <em>kā/kī/ke</em> (का/की/के).  Even if the
postpositional phrase can be understood as a genitive noun phrase, the
noun is not in genitive. Instead, the postposition requires that it
takes one of three case forms that are marked directly on the noun:
the oblique case (<code>Acc</code>).</p>

<h3 id="nom-nominative--direct"><code>Nom</code>: nominative / direct</h3>

<p>The base form of the noun, typically used as citation form (lemma).
In many languages this is the word form used for subjects of clauses.
If the language has only two cases, which are called “direct” and
“oblique”, the direct case will be marked Nom.</p>

<h3 id="acc-accusative--oblique"><code>Acc</code>: accusative / oblique</h3>

<p>Perhaps the second most widely spread morphological case. In many
languages this is the word form used for direct objects of verbs.  If
the language has only two cases, which are called “direct” and
“oblique”, the oblique case will be marked Acc.</p>

<h3 id="abs-absolutive"><code>Abs</code>: absolutive</h3>

<p>Some languages (e.g. Basque) do not use nominative-accusative to
distinguish subjects and objects.  Instead, they use the contrast of
absolutive-ergative.</p>

<p>The absolutive case marks subject of intransitive verb and direct
object of transitive verb.</p>

<h3 id="erg-ergative"><code>Erg</code>: ergative</h3>

<p>Some languages (e.g. Basque) do not use nominative-accusative to
distinguish subjects and objects.  Instead, they use the contrast of
absolutive-ergative.</p>

<p>The ergative case marks subject of transitive verb.</p>

<h3 id="dat-dative"><code>Dat</code>: dative</h3>

<p>In many languages this is the word form used for indirect objects of verbs.</p>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[de] <em>Ich gebe <b>meinem Bruder</b> ein Geschenk.</em> “I give my
brother a present.” (<em>meinem Bruder</em> “my brother” is dative and <em>ein
Geschenk</em> “a present” is accusative.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="gen-genitive"><code>Gen</code>: genitive</h3>

<p>Prototypical meaning of genitive is that the noun phrase somehow
belongs to its governor; it would often be translated by the English
preposition <em>of</em>.  English has the “saxon genitive” formed by the
suffix <em>‘s</em>; but we will normally not need the feature in English
because the suffix gets separated from the noun during tokenization.</p>

<p>Note that despite considerable semantic overlap, the genitive case is
not the same as the feature of possessivity (<a href="">Poss</a>). Possessivity
is a lexical feature, i.e. it applies to lemma and its whole
paradigm. Genitive is a feature of just a subset of word forms of the
lemma. Semantics of possessivity is much more clearly defined while
the genitive (as many other cases) may be required in situations that
have nothing to do with possessing. For example, [cs] <em>bez
prezidentovy dcery</em> “without the president’s daughter” is a
prepositional phrase containing the preposition <em>bez</em> “without”, the
possessive adjective <em>prezidentovy</em> “president’s” and the noun <em>dcery</em>
“daughter”.  The possessive adjective is derived from the noun
<em>prezident</em> but it is really an adjective (with separate lemma and
paradigm), not just a form of the noun. In addition, both the
adjective and the noun are in their genitive forms (the nominative
would be <em>prezidentova dcera</em>).  There is nothing possessive about
this particular occurrence of the genitive. It is there because the
preposition <em>bez</em> always requires its argument to be in genitive.</p>

<h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em>Praha je hlavní město <b>České republiky</b>.</em> “Prague is the
capital <b>of the Czech Republic</b>.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in Basque, Gen should be used for possessive genitive (as
opposed to locative genitive): <em><b>diktadorearen</b> erregimena</em>
“dictator’s regime”; <em>diktadore</em> “dictator”.</p>

<h3 id="voc-vocative"><code>Voc</code>: vocative</h3>

<p>The vocative case is a special form of noun used to address
someone. Thus it predominantly appears with animate nouns (see the
feature of <a href="">Animacy</a>). Nevertheless this is not a grammatical
restriction and inanimate things can be addressed as well.</p>

<h4 id="examples-3">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em>Co myslíš, <b>Filip</b><b>e</b>?</em> “What do you think,
<b>Filip</b>?”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="loc-locative"><code>Loc</code>: locative</h3>

<p>The locative case often expresses location in space or time, which
gave it its name. As elsewhere, non-locational meanings also exist and
they are not rare. Uralic languages have a complex set of fine-grained
locational and directional cases (see below) instead of the
locative. Even in languages that have locative, some location roles
may be expressed using other cases (e.g. because those cases are
required by a preposition).</p>

<p>In Slavic languages this is the only case that is used exclusively in
combination with prepositions (but such a restriction may not hold in
other languages that have locative).</p>

<h4 id="examples-4">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em>V <b>červenci</b> jsem byl ve <b>Švédsku</b>.</em> “In <b>July</b>
I was in <b>Sweden</b>.”</li>
  <li>[cs] <em>Mluvili jsme tam o <b>morfologii</b>.</em> “We talked there about
<b>morphology</b>.” (Non-locational non-temporal example)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ins-instrumental--instructive"><code>Ins</code>: instrumental / instructive</h3>

<p>The role from which the name of the instrumental case is derived is
that the noun is used as instrument to do something (as in [cs] <em>psát
<b>perem</b></em> “to write <b>using a pen</b>”).  Many other meanings are
possible, e.g. in Czech the instrumental is required by the
preposition <em>s</em> “with” and thus it includes the meaning expressed in
other languages by the comitative case.</p>

<p>In Czech the instrumental is also used for the agent-object in passive
constructions (cf. the English preposition <em>by</em>).</p>

<h4 id="examples-5">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em>Tento zákon byl schválen <b>vládou</b>.</em> “This bill has been
approved <b>by the government</b>.” (Passive example)</li>
</ul>

<p>A semantically similar case called instructive is used rarely in
Finnish to express “with (the aid of)”. It can be applied to
infinitives that behave much like nouns in Finnish.  We propose one
label for both instrumental and instructive (instrumental is not
defined in Finnish).</p>

<h4 id="examples-6">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[fi] <em>lähteä</em> “to leave”; <em>2003 <b>lähtien</b></em> “since 2003” (second
infinitive in the instructive case)</li>
  <li>[fi] <em>yllättää</em> “to surprise”; <em>sekaantui <b>yllättäen</b>
valtataisteluun</em> lit. <em>was-involved-in by-surprise.Ins
power-struggle.Ill.</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="par-partitive"><code>Par</code>: partitive</h3>

<p>In Finnish the partitive case expresses indefinite identity and
unfinished actions without result.</p>

<h4 id="examples-7">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[fi] <em>kolme <b>taloa</b></em> “three <b>houses</b>”; (the <em>-a</em> suffix of
<em>talo</em>)</li>
  <li>[fi] <em>rakastan tätä <b>taloa</b></em> “I love this <b>house</b>”</li>
  <li>[fi] <em>saanko lainata <b>kirjaa</b>?</em> “can I borrow the <b>book</b>?”
(the <em>-a</em> suffix of <em>kirja</em>)</li>
  <li>[fi]<em>lasissa on <b>maitoa</b></em> “there is (some) <b>milk</b> in the
glass”</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples comparing partitive with accusative: <em>ammuin karhun</em> “I shot
a bear.Acc” (and I know that it is dead); <em>ammuin karhua</em> “I shot at a
bear.Par” (but I may have missed).</p>

<p>Using accusative instead of partitive may also substitute the missing
future tense: <em>luen kirjan</em> “I will read the book.Acc”; <em>luen kirjaa</em>
“I am reading the book.Par”.</p>

<h3 id="dis-distributive"><code>Dis</code>: distributive</h3>

<p>The distributive case conveys that something happened to every member
of a set, one in a time. Or it may express frequency.</p>

<h4 id="examples-8">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[hu] <em><b>fejenként</b></em> “per capita”</li>
  <li>[hu] <em><b>esetenként</b></em> “in some cases”</li>
  <li>[hu] <em><b>hetenként</b></em> “once per week, weekly”</li>
  <li>[hu] <em><b>tízpercenként</b></em> “every ten minutes”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ess-essive--prolative"><code>Ess</code>: essive / prolative</h3>

<p>The essive case expresses a temporary state, often it corresponds to
English “as a …” A similar case in Basque is called prolative
and it should be tagged <code>Ess</code> too.</p>

<h4 id="examples-9">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[fi] <em>lapsi</em> “child”; <em><b>lapsena</b></em> “as a child / when he/she was child”</li>
  <li>[et] <em>laps</em> “child”; <em><b>lapsena</b></em> “as a child”</li>
  <li>[eu] <em>erreformista</em> “reformer”; <em><b>erreformistatzat</b></em> “as a reformer”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tra-translative--factive"><code>Tra</code>: translative / factive</h3>

<p>The translative case expresses a change of state (“it becomes X”, “it
changes to X”).  Also used for the phrase “in language X”. In the
Szeged Treebank, this case is called factive.</p>

<h4 id="examples-10">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[fi] <em>pitkä</em> “long”; <em>kasvoi <b>pitkäksi</b></em> “grew long”</li>
  <li>[fi] <em>englanti</em> “English language”; <em><b>englanniksi</b></em> “in/into English”</li>
  <li>[fi] <em>kello kuusi</em> “six o’clock”; <em>kello <b>kuudeksi</b></em> “by six o’clock”</li>
  <li>[et] <em>kell kuus</em> “six o’clock”; <em>kella <b>kuueks</b></em> “by six o’clock”</li>
  <li>[hu] <em>Oroszlány halott <b>várossá</b> válhat.</em> lit. <em>Oroszlány dead city.Tra
could-become.</em> “Oroszlány could become a dead city.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="com-comitative--associative"><code>Com</code>: comitative / associative</h3>

<p>The comitative (also called associative) case corresponds to English
“together with …”</p>

<h4 id="examples-11">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[et] <em>koer</em> “dog”; <em><b>koeraga</b></em> “with dog”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="abe-abessive"><code>Abe</code>: abessive</h3>

<p>The abessive case corresponds to the English preposition <em>without</em>.</p>

<h4 id="examples-12">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[fi] <em>raha</em> “money”; <em><b>rahatta</b></em> “without money”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ine-inessive"><code>Ine</code>: inessive</h3>

<p>The inessive case expresses location inside of something.</p>

<h4 id="examples-13">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[hu] <em>ház</em> “house”; <em><b>házban</b></em> “in the house”</li>
  <li>[fi] <em>talo</em> “house”; <em><b>talossa</b></em> “in the house”</li>
  <li>[et] <em>maja</em> “house”; <em><b>majas</b></em> “in the house”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ill-illative"><code>Ill</code>: illative</h3>

<p>The illative case expresses direction into something.</p>

<h4 id="examples-14">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[hu]<em>ház</em> “house”; <em><b>házb</b><b>a</b></em> “into the house”</li>
  <li>[fi] <em>talo</em> “house”; <em><b>talo</b><b>on</b></em> “into the house”</li>
  <li>[et] <em>maja</em> “house”; <em><b>majas</b><b>se / majja</b></em> “into the house”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ela-elative"><code>Ela</code>: elative</h3>

<p>The elative case expresses direction out of something.</p>

<h4 id="examples-15">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[hu]<em>ház</em> “house”; <em><b>házból</b></em> “from the house”</li>
  <li>[fi] <em>talo</em> “house”; <em><b>talos</b><b>t</b><b>a</b></em> “from the house”</li>
  <li>[et] <em>maja</em> “house”; <em><b>majas</b><b>t</b></em> “from the house”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="add-additive"><code>Add</code>: additive</h3>

<p>Distinguished by some scholars in Estonian, not recognized by
traditional grammar, exists in the Multext-East Estonian tagset and in
the Eesti keele puudepank.  Reportedly same or similar meaning as
illative. Forms of this case exist only in singular and not for all
nouns.</p>

<h3 id="ade-adessive"><code>Ade</code>: adessive</h3>

<p>The adessive case expresses location at or on something.  The
corresponding directional cases are allative (towards something) and
ablative (from something).</p>

<h4 id="examples-16">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[hu] <em>pénztár</em> “cash desk”; <em><b>pénztárnál</b></em> “at the cash desk”</li>
  <li>[fi] <em>pöytä</em> “table”; <em><b>pöydällä</b></em> “on the table”</li>
  <li>[et] <em>laud</em> “table”;<em><b>laual</b></em> “on the table”</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that adessive is used to express location on the surface of
something in Finnish and Estonian, but does not carry this meaning in
Hungarian.</p>

<h3 id="all-allative"><code>All</code>: allative</h3>

<p>The allative case expresses direction to something (destination is
adessive, i.e. at or on that something).</p>

<h4 id="examples-17">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[hu] <em>pénztár</em> “cash desk”; <em><b>pénztár</b><b>hoz</b></em> “to the cash desk”</li>
  <li>[fi] <em>pöytä</em> “table”; <em><b>pöydäll</b><b>e</b></em> “onto the table”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="abl-ablative"><code>Abl</code>: ablative</h3>

<p>Prototypical meaning: direction from some point.</p>

<h4 id="examples-18">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[hu] <em>a <b>barátomtól</b> jövök</em> “I’m coming <b>from my friend</b>”</li>
  <li>[fi] <em>pöydältä</em> “from the table”; <em>katolta</em> “from the roof”;
<em>rannalta</em> “from the beach”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sup-superessive"><code>Sup</code>: superessive</h3>

<p>Used, chiefly <a href="http://www.hungarianreference.com/Nouns/-n-superessive.aspx">in
Hungarian</a>,
to indicate location on top of something or on the surface of
something.</p>

<h4 id="examples-19">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[hu] <em>asztal</em> “table”; <em><b>asztalon</b></em> “on the table”</li>
  <li>[hu] <em>könyvek</em> “books”; <em><b>könyveken</b></em> “on books”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sub-sublative"><code>Sub</code>: sublative</h3>

<p>The sublative case is used in Finno-Ugric languages to express the
destination of movement, originally to the surface of something
(e.g. “to climb a tree”), and, by extension, in other figurative
meanings as well (e.g. “to university”).</p>

<h4 id="examples-20">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[hu] <em>Belgrádtól 150 <b>kilométerre délnyugatra</b></em> lit.
<em>Belgrade.Abl 150 kilometer.Sub southwest.Sub</em> “150 kilometers
southwest of Belgrade”</li>
  <li>[hu] <em>hajó</em> “ship”; <em><b>hajóra</b></em> “onto the ship”</li>
  <li>[hu] <em><b>bokorra</b></em> “on the shrub”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="del-delative"><code>Del</code>: delative</h3>

<p>Used, chiefly <a href="http://www.hungarianreference.com/Nouns/ról-rol-delative.aspx">in
Hungarian</a>,
to express the movement from the surface of something (like “moved off
the table”). Other meanings are possible as well, e.g. “about
something”.</p>

<h4 id="examples-21">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[hu] <em>asztal</em> “table”; <em>az <b>asztal</b><b>ról</b></em> “off the table”</li>
  <li>[hu]<em><b>Budapestről</b> jövök</em> “I am coming from Budapest”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lat-lative--directional-allative"><code>Lat</code>: lative / directional allative</h3>

<p>The lative case denotes movement towards/to/into/onto
something. Similar case in Basque is called directional allative
(Spanish <em>adlativo direccional</em>).  However, lative is typically
thought of as a union of allative, illative and sublative, while in
Basque it is derived from allative, which also exists independently.</p>

<h4 id="examples-22">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[eu] <em>behe</em> “low”; <em><b>beherantz</b></em> “down”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tem-temporal"><code>Tem</code>: temporal</h3>

<p>The temporal case is used to indicate time.</p>

<h4 id="examples-23">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[hu] <em><b>hétkor</b></em> “at seven (o’clock)”; <em><b>éjfélkor</b></em> “at midnight”;
<em><b>karácsonykor</b></em> “at Christmas”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ter-terminative--terminal-allative"><code>Ter</code>: terminative / terminal allative</h3>

<p>The terminative case specifies where something ends in space or
time. Similar case in Basque is called terminal allative (Spanish
<em>adlativo terminal</em>).</p>

<h4 id="examples-24">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[et] <em><b>jõeni</b></em> “down to the river”; <em>kella <b>kuueni</b></em>
“till six o’clock”</li>
  <li>[hu] <em>a <b>házig</b></em> “up to the house”; <em>hat <b>óráig</b></em> “till
six o’clock”</li>
  <li>[eu] <em>erdi</em> “half”; <em><b>erdiraino</b></em> “up to the half”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cau-causative--motivative"><code>Cau</code>: causative / motivative</h3>

<p>Noun in this case is the cause of something. In Hungarian it also
seems to be used frequently with currency (“to buy something <em>for</em> the
money”) and it also can mean the goal of something.</p>

<h4 id="examples-25">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[hu] <em>Egy világcég benzinkútjánál 7183 <b>forintért</b> tankoltam.</em>
lit. <em>a world-wide.company petrol.station.Ade 7183 forint.Cau
refueled</em> “I refueled my car at the petrol station of a world-wide
company for 7183 forints.”</li>
  <li>[hu] <em>Elmentem a boltba <b>tejért</b>.</em> lit. <em>went the shop.Ill
milk.Cau</em> “I went to the shop to buy milk.”</li>
  <li>[eu] <em>jokaera</em> “behavior”; <em><b>jokaeragatik</b></em> “because of
behavior”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ben-benefactive--destinative"><code>Ben</code>: benefactive / destinative</h3>

<p>The benefactive case corresponds to the English preposition <em>for</em>.</p>

<h4 id="examples-26">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[eu] <em>mutil</em> “boy”; <em><b>mutilarentzat</b></em> “for boys”</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="al-u-feat/Definite" class="al-dest"></a></p>
<h2><code>Definite</code>: definiteness or state</h2>

<p>Definiteness is typically a feature of nouns, adjectives and
articles. Its value distinguishes whether we are talking about
something known and concrete, or something general or unknown. It can
be marked on definite and indefinite <a href="u-pos/DET">articles</a>, or
directly on <a href="u-pos/NOUN">nouns</a>, <a href="u-pos/ADJ">adjectives</a> etc.  In
Arabic, definiteness is also called the “state”.</p>

<h3 id="ind-indefinite"><code>Ind</code>: indefinite</h3>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em><b>a</b> dog</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="def-definite"><code>Def</code>: definite</h3>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em><b>the</b> dog</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="red-reduced"><code>Red</code>: reduced</h3>

<p>Used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_constructus">construct
state</a> in Arabic. If
two nouns are in genitive relation, the first one (the “nomen regens”)
has “reduced definiteness,” the second is the genitive and can be
either definite or indefinite.  Reduced form has neither the definite
morpheme (article), nor the indefinite morpheme (nunation).</p>

<h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[ar] indefinite state: حلوَةٌ_ḥulwatun_ “a sweet”; definite state:
الحلوَةُ <em>al-ḥulwatu</em> “the sweet”; <b>حلوَةُ </b><em><b>ḥulwatu</b></em>
“sweet of”.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="com-complex"><code>Com</code>: complex</h3>

<p>Used in <a href="http://books.google.cz/books?id=rs3hzfgj3hoC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=arabic+improper+annexation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d6gGCpprOX&amp;sig=3G6YkRZsIy_EL0OCEh7_V7qqnlE&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=ZasDTuLhGc_vsgaLlcyeDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=arabic%20improper%20annexation&amp;f=false">improper
annexation</a> in Arabic. The genitive construction described above
normally consists of two nouns (first reduced, second genitive). That
is called proper annexation or iḍāfa. If the first member is an
adjective or adjectivally used participle and the second member is a
definite noun, the construction is called improper annexation or false
iḍāfa.  The result is a compound adjective that is usually used as an
attributive adjunct and thus must agree in definiteness with the noun
it modifies. Its first part (the adjective or participle) may get
again the definite article. Although it may look the same as the form
for the definite state, it is assigned a special value of <em>complex</em>
state to reflect the different origin. See also <a href="http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/padt/PADT_1.0/docs/papers/2004-nemlar-padt.pdf">Hajič

<p><a id="al-u-feat/Degree" class="al-dest"></a></p>
<h2><code>Degree</code>: degree of comparison</h2>

<p>Degree of comparison is typically an inflectional feature of some
<a href="u-pos/ADJ">adjectives</a> and <a href="u-pos/ADV">adverbs</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pos-positive-first-degree"><code>Pos</code>: positive, first degree</h3>

<p>This is the base form that merely states a quality of something,
without comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this
degree is traditionally called “positive”, negative properties can be
compared, too.</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em><b>young</b> man</em></li>
  <li>[cs] <em><b>mladý</b> muž</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cmp-comparative-second-degree"><code>Cmp</code>: comparative, second degree</h3>

<p>The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object.</p>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em>the man is <b>younger</b> than me</em></li>
  <li>[cs] <em>ten muž je <b>mladší</b> než já</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sup-superlative-third-degree"><code>Sup</code>: superlative, third degree</h3>

<p>The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set.</p>

<h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em>this is the <b>youngest</b> man in our team</em></li>
  <li>[cs] <em>toto je <b>nejmladší</b> muž v našem týmu</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="abs-absolute-superlative"><code>Abs</code>: absolute superlative</h3>

<p>Some languages can express morphologically that the studied quality of
the given object is so strong that there is hardly any other object
exceeding it. The quality is not actually compared to any particular
set of objects.</p>

<h4 id="examples-3">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[es] <em>guapo</em> “handsome”; <em><b>guapísimo</b></em> “<b>indescribably
handsome</b>”</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="al-u-feat/Gender" class="al-dest"></a></p>
<h2><code>Gender</code>: gender</h2>

<p>Gender is usually a lexical feature of nouns and inflectional feature
of other parts of speech (adjectives, verbs) that mark agreement with
nouns. In English gender affects only the choice of the personal
pronoun <em>(he / she / it)</em> and the feature is usually not encoded in
English tagsets.</p>

<p>See also the related feature of <a href="">Animacy</a>.</p>

<p>African languages have an analogous feature of noun classes: there
might be separate grammatical categories for flat objects, long thin
objects etc. African noun classes are not covered in the current
proposal because none of the tagsets on which the proposal is based
are for a language with noun classes. They might be added in future.</p>

<h3 id="masc-masculine-gender"><code>Masc</code>: masculine gender</h3>

<p>Nouns denoting male persons are masculine. Other nouns may be also
grammatically masculine, without any relation to sex.</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em><b>hrad</b></em> “castle”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fem-feminine-gender"><code>Fem</code>: feminine gender</h3>

<p>Nouns denoting female persons are feminine. Other nouns may be also
grammatically feminine, without any relation to sex.</p>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[de] <em><b>Burg</b></em> “castle”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="neut-neuter-gender"><code>Neut</code>: neuter gender</h3>

<p>Some languages have only the masculine/feminine distinction while
others also have this third gender for nouns that are neither
masculine nor feminine (grammatically).</p>

<h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em><b>dítě</b></em> “child”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="com-common-gender"><code>Com</code>: common gender</h3>

<p>Some languages do not distinguish masculine/feminine most of the time
but they do distinguish neuter vs. non-neuter (Swedish neutrum /
utrum). The non-neuter is called common gender.</p>

<p>Note that it could also be expressed as a combined value
<code>Gender=Fem,Masc</code>. Nevertheless we keep <code>Com</code> also as a separate
value. Combined feature values should only be used in exceptional,
undecided cases, not for something that occurs systematically in the
grammar. Language-specific extensions to these guidelines should
determine whether the <code>Com</code> value is appropriate for a particular
language.</p>

<p><a id="al-u-feat/Mood" class="al-dest"></a></p>
<h2><code>Mood</code>: mood</h2>

<p>Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
verb forms.</p>

<h3 id="ind-indicative"><code>Ind</code>: indicative</h3>

<p>The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em><b>Studuješ</b> na univerzitě.</em> “<b>You study</b> at the
university.”</li>
  <li>[de] <em><b>Du studierst</b> an der Universität.</em> “<b>You study</b> at
the university.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="imp-imperative"><code>Imp</code>: imperative</h3>

<p>The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.</p>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em><b>Studuj</b> na univerzitě!</em> “<b>Study</b> at the university!”</li>
  <li>[de] <em><b>Studiere</b> an der Universität!</em> “<b>Study</b> at the university!”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cnd-conditional"><code>Cnd</code>: conditional</h3>

<p>The conditional mood is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen. Grammars of some languages may classify conditional as tense
(rather than mood) but e.g. in Czech it combines with two different
tenses (past and present).</p>

<h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em>Kdy <b>bych</b> byl chytrý, studoval <b>bych</b> na
univerzitě.</em> “If I were smart I <b>would</b> study at the
university” (note that only the auxiliary <em>bych</em> is specific to
conditional; the active participle <em>byl</em> is also needed to
analytically form the conditional mood, however, it will only be
tagged as participle because it can also be used to form past tense
indicative.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pot-potential"><code>Pot</code>: potential</h3>

<p>The action of the verb is likely but not certain. Used e.g. in
Finnish.</p>

<h3 id="sub-subjunctive--conjunctive"><code>Sub</code>: subjunctive / conjunctive</h3>

<p>The subjunctive mood is used under certain circumstances in
subordinate clauses, typically for actions that are subjective or
otherwise uncertain. In German, it may be also used to convey the
conditional meaning.</p>

<h4 id="examples-3">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[fr] <em>Je veux que tu le <b>fasses</b> “I want you to do it” lit. _I
want that you it do.Sub</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="jus-jussive"><code>Jus</code>: jussive</h3>

<p>The jussive mood expresses the desire that the action happens. Used
e.g. in Arabic.</p>

<h3 id="qot-quotative"><code>Qot</code>: quotative</h3>

<p>The quotative mood is used e.g. in Estonian to denote direct speech.</p>

<h3 id="opt-optative"><code>Opt</code>: optative</h3>

<p>Used e.g. in Turkish in exclamations like “May you have a long life!”
or “If only I were rich!”</p>

<h3 id="des-desiderative"><code>Des</code>: desiderative</h3>

<p>The desiderative mood corresponds to the modal verb “want to”: “He
<b>wants to come</b>.” Used e.g. in Turkish.</p>

<h3 id="nec-necessitative"><code>Nec</code>: necessitative</h3>

<p>The necessitative mood corresponds to the modal verbs “must, should,
have to”: “He <b>must</b><b> come</b>.” Used e.g. in Turkish.</p>

<p><a id="al-u-feat/Negative" class="al-dest"></a></p>
<h2><code>Negative</code>: whether the word can be or is negated</h2>

<p>Negativeness is typically a feature of <a href="u-pos/VERB">verbs</a>,
<a href="u-pos/ADJ">adjectives</a>, sometimes also <a href="u-pos/ADV">adverbs</a> and
<a href="u-pos/NOUN">nouns</a> in languages that negate using bound
morphemes. For instance, all Czech verbs and adjectives can be negated
using the prefix <em>ne-</em>.  In English, verbs are negated using the
<a href="u-pos/PART">particle</a> <em>not</em> and adjectives are also negated using
prefixes, although the process is less productive than in Czech <em>(wise
– unwise, probable – improbable)</em>.</p>

<p>Note that <code>Negative=Neg</code> is not the same thing as
<a href="">PronType</a><code>=Neg</code>. For pronouns and other pronominal parts of speech
there is no such binary opposition as for verbs and adjectives. (There
is no such thing as “affirmative pronoun”.)</p>

<p>The negativeness feature could be also used to distinguish response
<a href="u-pos/INTJ">interjections</a> <em>yes</em> and <em>no</em>.</p>

<h3 id="pos-positive-affirmative"><code>Pos</code>: positive, affirmative</h3>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em><b>přišel</b></em> “he came”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="neg-negative">Neg: negative</h3>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em><b>nepřišel</b></em> “he did not come”</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="al-u-feat/NumType" class="al-dest"></a></p>
<h2><code>NumType</code>: numeral type</h2>

<p>Some languages (especially Slavic) have a complex system of
<a href="u-pos/NUM">numerals</a>. For example, in the school grammar of Czech,
the main part of speech is “numeral”, it includes almost everything
where counting is involved and there are various subtypes. It also
includes interrogative, relative, indefinite and demonstrative words
referring to numbers (words like <em>kolik / how many, tolik / so many,
několik / some, a few),</em> so at the same time we may have a non-empty
value of <a href="">PronType</a>.  (In English, these words are called
quantifiers and they are considered a subgroup of
<a href="u-pos/DET">determiners</a>.)</p>

<p>From the syntactic point of view, some numtypes behave like adjectives
and some behave like adverbs. We tag them <a href="">u-pos/ADJ</a> and
<a href="">u-pos/ADV</a> respectively. Thus the <code>NumType</code> feature applies to
several different parts of speech:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="">u-pos/NUM</a>: cardinal numerals</li>
  <li><a href="">u-pos/DET</a>: quantifiers</li>
  <li><a href="">u-pos/ADJ</a>: definite adjectival, e.g. ordinal numerals</li>
  <li><a href="">u-pos/ADV</a>: adverbial (e.g. ordinal and multiplicative) numerals, both definite and pronominal</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="card-cardinal-number-or-corresponding-interrogative--relative--indefinite--demonstrative-word"><code>Card</code>: cardinal number or corresponding interrogative / relative / indefinite / demonstrative word</h3>

<p>Note that in some Indo-European languages there is a fuzzy borderline
between numerals and nouns for <em>thousand, million</em> and <em>billion.</em></p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em>one, two, three</em> </li>
  <li>[cs] <em>jeden, dva, tři</em> “one, two, three”; <em>kolik</em> “how many”;
<em>několik</em> “some”; <em>tolik</em> “so many”; <em>mnoho</em> “many”; <em>málo</em> “few”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ord-ordinal-number-or-corresponding-interrogative--relative--indefinite--demonstrative-word"><code>Ord</code>: ordinal number or corresponding interrogative / relative / indefinite / demonstrative word</h3>

<p>This is a subtype of adjective or (in some languages) of adverb.</p>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em>first, second, third;</em> </li>
  <li>[cs] adjectival: <em>první</em> “first”; <em>druhý</em> “second”, <em>třetí</em> “third”;
<em>kolikátý</em> lit. <em>how manieth</em> “which rank”; <em>několikátý</em> “some
rank”; <em>tolikátý</em> “this/that rank”</li>
  <li>[cs] adverbial: <em>poprvé</em> “for the first time”; <em>podruhé</em> “for the
second time”; <em>potřetí</em> “for the third time”; <em>pokolikáté</em> “for
which time”, <em>poněkolikáté</em> “for x-th time”, <em>potolikáté</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mult-multiplicative-numeral-or-corresponding-interrogative--relative--indefinite--demonstrative-word"><code>Mult</code>: multiplicative numeral or corresponding interrogative / relative / indefinite / demonstrative word</h3>

<p>This is subtype of adverb.</p>

<h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em>jednou</em> “once”; <em>dvakrát</em> “twice”; <em>třikrát</em> “three times”;
<em>kolikrát</em> “how many times”, <em>několikrát</em> “several times”;
<em>tolikrát</em> “so many times”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="frac-fraction"><code>Frac</code>: fraction</h3>

<p>This is a subtype of cardinal numbers, occasionally distinguished in
corpora. It may denote a fraction or just the denominator of the
fraction. In various languages these words may behave morphologically
and syntactically as nouns or ordinal numerals.</p>

<h4 id="examples-3">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em>three-quarters</em></li>
  <li>[cs] <em>půl / polovina</em> “half”; <em>třetina</em> “one third”; <em>čtvrt /
čtvrtina</em> “quarter”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sets-number-of-sets-of-things"><code>Sets</code>: number of sets of things</h3>

<p>Morphologically distinct class of numerals used to count sets of
things, or nouns that are pluralia tantum.</p>

<h4 id="examples-4">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em><b>dvoje</b> / <b>troje</b> boty</em> “<b>two</b> / <b>three</b>
[pairs of] shoes”; as opposed to normal cardinal numbers: <em>dvě / tři
boty</em> “two / three shoes”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dist-distributive-numeral"><code>Dist</code>: distributive numeral</h3>

<p>Used to express that the same quantity is distributed to each member
in a set of targets.</p>

<h4 id="examples-5">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[hu] <em>három-három in gyermekenként <b>három-három</b> ezer
forinttal</em> “three thousand forint per child”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="range-range-of-values"><code>Range</code>: range of values</h3>

<p>This could be considered a subtype of cardinal numbers, occasionally
distinguished in corpora.</p>

<h4 id="examples-6">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em>two-five</em> “two to five” (provided tokenization leaves it as
one token.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="gen-generic-numeral-ie-a-numeral-that-is-neither-of-the-above"><code>Gen</code>: generic numeral, i.e. a numeral that is neither of the above</h3>

<p>Czech school grammar distinguishes this subclass, which is why it
appears in Czech tagsets. Other Slavic languages may have similar
words but their traditional classification may differ. (Note that
“generic numerals” in Czech grammar also include the <code>Sets</code> subclass
mentioned above.)</p>

<h4 id="examples-7">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em><b>čtvero, patero, desatero</b></em> (specific forms of four,

<p><code>Number</code> is usually an inflectional feature of <a href="u-pos/NOUN">nouns</a> and,
depending on language, other parts of speech (<a href="u-pos/ADJ">adjectives</a>,
<a href="u-pos/VERB">verbs</a>) that mark agreement with nouns.</p>

<h3 id="sing-singular-number"><code>Sing</code>: singular number</h3>

<p>A singular noun denotes one person, animal or thing.</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em><b>car</b></em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="plur-plural-number"><code>Plur</code>: plural number</h3>

<p>A plural noun denotes several persons, animals or things.</p>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em><b>cars</b></em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dual-dual-number"><code>Dual</code>: dual number</h3>

<p>A dual noun denotes two persons, animals or things.</p>

<h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[sl] singular <em>glas</em> “voice”, dual <em><b>glasova</b></em> “voices”, plural
<em>glasovi</em> “voices”</li>
  <li>[ar] singular سَنَةٌ <em>sanatun</em> “year”, dual <b>سَنَتَانِ
<em>sanatāni</em></b> “years”, plural سِنُونَ <em>sinūna</em> “years”.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ptan-plurale-tantum"><code>Ptan</code>: plurale tantum</h3>

<p>Some nouns appear only in the plural form even though they denote one
thing (semantic singular); some tagsets mark this distinction.
Grammatically they behave like plurals, so <code>Plur</code> is obviously the
back-off value here; however, if the language also marks gender, the
non-existence of singular form sometimes means that the gender is
unknown. In Czech, special type of numerals is used when counting
nouns that are plurale tantum (<a href="">NumType</a> = Sets).</p>

<h4 id="examples-3">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em><b>scissors, pants</b></em></li>
  <li>[cs] <em><b>nůžky, kalhoty</b></em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="coll-collective--mass--singulare-tantum"><code>Coll</code>: collective / mass / singulare tantum</h3>

<p>Collective or mass or singulare tantum is a special case of
singular. It applies to words that use grammatical singular to
describe sets of objects, i.e. semantic plural. Although in theory
they might be able to form plural, in practice it would be rarely
semantically plausible. Sometimes, the plural form exists and means
“several sorts of” or “several packages of”.</p>

<h4 id="examples-4">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em><b>lidstvo</b></em> “mankind”</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="al-u-feat/Person" class="al-dest"></a></p>
<h2><code>Person</code>: person</h2>

<p>Person is typically feature of personal and possessive
<a href="u-pos/PRON">pronouns</a> / <a href="u-pos/DET">determiners</a>, and of <a href="u-pos/VERB">verbs</a>. On verbs it is in
fact an agreement feature that marks the person of the verb’s subject
(some languages, e.g. Basque, can also mark person of objects). Person
marked on verbs makes it unnecessary to always add a personal pronoun
as subject and thus subjects are sometimes dropped (pro-drop
languages).</p>

<h3 id="first-person"><code>1</code>: first person</h3>

<p>In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons. Some languages (e.g. Taiwanese) distinguish inclusive and
exclusive 1<sup>st</sup> person plural pronouns: the former include
the addressee of the utterance (i.e. <em>I + you</em>), the latter exclude
them (i.e. <em>I + they</em>).</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em><b>I</b></em>, <em><b>we</b></em></li>
  <li>[cs] <em><b>dělám</b></em> “<b>I</b> do”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="second-person"><code>2</code>: second person</h3>

<p>In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the
utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and
optionally some third persons too.</p>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em><b>you</b></em></li>
  <li>[cs] <em><b>děláš</b></em> “<b>you</b> do”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="third-person"><code>3</code>: third person</h3>

<p>The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither
speakers nor addressees.</p>

<h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em><b>he</b></em>, <em><b>she</b></em>, <em><b>it</b></em>, <em><b>they</b></em></li>
  <li>[cs] <em><b>dělá</b></em> “<b>he/she/it does</b>”</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="al-u-feat/Poss" class="al-dest"></a></p>
<h2><code>Poss</code>: possessive</h2>

<p>Boolean feature of pronouns, determiners or adjectives.  It tells
whether the word is possessive.</p>

<p>While many tagsets would have “possessive” as one of the various
pronoun types, this feature is intentionally separate from
<a href="">PronType</a>, as it is orthogonal to pronominal types. Several of the
pronominal types can be optionally possessive, and adjectives can too.</p>

<h3 id="yes-it-is-possessive"><code>Yes</code>: it is possessive</h3>

<p>Note that there is no <code>No</code> value. If the word is not possessive, the
<code>Poss</code> feature will just not be mentioned in the <code>FEAT</code> column. (Which
means that empty value has the <code>No</code> meaning.)</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em>my, your, his, mine, yours, whose</em> </li>
  <li>[cs] possessive adjectives: <em>otcův</em> “father’s”, <em>matčin</em> “mother’s”</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/universaldependencies/docs/edit/pages-source/_u-feat/Poss.md" target="#">edit Poss</a></p>

<p><a id="al-u-feat/PronType" class="al-dest"></a></p>
<h2><code>PronType</code>: pronominal type</h2>

<p>This feature typically applies to <a href="u-pos/PRON">pronouns</a>,
<a href="u-pos/DET">determiners</a>, pronominal <a href="u-pos/NUM">numerals</a>
(quantifiers) and pronominal <a href="u-pos/ADV">adverbs</a>.</p>

<h3 id="prs-personal-or-possessive-personal-pronoun-or-determiner"><code>Prs</code>: personal or possessive personal pronoun or determiner</h3>

<p>See also the <a href="">Poss</a> feature that distinguishes normal personal
pronouns from possessives. Note that <code>Prs</code> also includes reflexive
personal/possessive pronouns (e.g. [cs] <em>se / svůj;</em> see the
<a href="">Reflex</a> feature).</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em>I, you, he, she, it, we, they, my, your, his, her, its, our,
their, mine, yours, hers, ours, theirs</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rcp-reciprocal-pronoun"><code>Rcp</code>: reciprocal pronoun</h3>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[de] <em>einander,</em> “each other”</li>
  <li>[da] <em>hinanden</em> “each other”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="art-article"><code>Art</code>: article</h3>

<p>Article is a special case of determiner that bears the feature of
<a href="Definite">definiteness</a> (in other languages, the feature may be
marked directly on nouns).</p>

<h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em>a, an, the</em> </li>
  <li>[de] <em>ein, eine, der, die, das</em> </li>
  <li>[es] <em>un, una, el, la</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="int-interrogative-pronoun-determiner-numeral-or-adverb"><code>Int</code>: interrogative pronoun, determiner, numeral or adverb</h3>

<p>Note that possessive interrogative determiners (<em>whose</em>) can be
distinguished by the <a href="">Poss</a> feature.</p>

<h4 id="examples-3">Examples:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs/en] <em>kdo / who, co / what, který / which, čí / whose, kolik /
how many, how much, kolikátý / how-maniest</em> (ordinal number),
<em>kolikrát / how many times, kde / where, kam / where to, kdy / when,
jak / how, proč / why</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rel-relative-pronoun-determiner-numeral-or-adverb"><code>Rel</code>: relative pronoun, determiner, numeral or adverb</h3>

<p>Note that in many languages this class heavily overlaps with
interrogatives, yet there are pronouns that are only relative, and in
some languages (Bulgarian, Hindi) the two classes seem to be distinct.</p>

<h4 id="examples-4">Examples:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em>jenž, což</em> “which”, “that” (relative but not interrogative
pronouns); <em>jehož</em> “whose” (possessive relative pronoun)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dem-demonstrative-pronoun-determiner-numeral-or-adverb"><code>Dem</code>: demonstrative pronoun, determiner, numeral or adverb</h3>

<p>These are often parallel to interrogatives. Some tagsets might also
distinguish a separate feature of distance (<em>here / there</em>; [es] <em>aquí
/ ahí / allí</em>).</p>

<h4 id="examples-5">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs/en] <em>tento / this, tamten / that, takový / such, týž / same,
tolik / so much, tolikátý / so-maniest</em> (ordinal number), <em>tolikrát
/ so many times, tady / here, tam / there, teď / now, tehdy / then,
tak / so</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tot-total-collective-pronoun-determiner-or-adverb"><code>Tot</code>: total (collective) pronoun, determiner or adverb</h3>

<h4 id="examples-6">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs/en] <em>každý / every, everybody, everyone, each, všechno /
everything, all, všude / everywhere, vždy / always</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="neg-negative-pronoun-determiner-or-adverb"><code>Neg</code>: negative pronoun, determiner or adverb</h3>

<p>Examples: </p>

<ul>
  <li>[cs/en] <em>nikdo / nobody, nic / nothing, nijaký / no, ničí / no
one’s</em> (possessive negative pronoun), <em>žádný / no, none, nikde /
nowhere, nikdy / never, nijak / no way</em> (lit. “no-how”)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ind-indefinite-pronoun-determiner-numeral-or-adverb"><code>Ind</code>: indefinite pronoun, determiner, numeral or adverb</h3>

<p>Note that some tagsets might further subclassify this category to
distinguish “some” from “any” etc. Such distinctions are not part of
universal features but may be added in language-specific extensions.</p>

<h4 id="examples-7">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs/en] <em>někdo / somebody, něco / something, některý / some, něčí /
someone’s</em> (possessive indefinite pronoun), <em>několik / a few,
several</em> (indefinite numeral/quantifier), <em>několikátý / “a fewth”,
“severalth”</em> (indefinite ordinal numeral), <em>několikrát / a few
times, several times, někde / somewhere, někdy / sometimes, nějak /
somehow</em></li>
  <li>[cs/en] <em>kdokoli / anybody, cokoli / anything, kterýkoli / any,

<p><a id="al-u-feat/Reflex" class="al-dest"></a></p>
<h2><code>Reflex</code>: reflexive</h2>

<p>Boolean feature, typically of <a href="u-pos/PRON">pronouns</a> or
<a href="u-pos/DET">determiners</a>. It tells whether the word is reflexive,
i.e. refers to the subject of its clause.</p>

<p>While many tagsets would have “reflexive” as one of the various
pronoun types, this feature is intentionally separate from
<a href="">PronType</a>, as it is orthogonal to pronominal types.</p>

<p>Note that while some languages also have reflexive verbs, these are in
fact fused verbs with reflexive pronouns, as in Spanish <em>despertarse</em>
or Russian <em>проснуться</em> (both meaning “to wake up”). Thus in these
cases the fused token will be split to two syntactic words, one of
them being a reflexive pronoun.</p>

<h3 id="yes-it-is-reflexive"><code>Yes</code>: it is reflexive</h3>

<p>Note that there is no <code>No</code> value. If the word is not reflexive, the
<code>Reflex</code> feature will just not be mentioned in the <code>FEAT</code>
column. (Which means that empty value has the <code>No</code> meaning.)</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] reflexive personal pronouns: <em>se, si</em>; reflexive possessive
pronoun: <em>svůj</em></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/universaldependencies/docs/edit/pages-source/_u-feat/Reflex.md" target="#">edit Reflex</a></p>

<p><a id="al-u-feat/Tense" class="al-dest"></a></p>
<h2><code>Tense</code>: tense</h2>

<p>Tense is a feature that specifies the time when the action took /
takes / will take place, in relation to the current moment or to
another action in the utterance. In some languages (e.g. English),
some tenses are actually combinations of tense and
<a href="Aspect">aspect</a>. In other languages (e.g. Czech), aspect and tense
are separate, although not completely independent of each other.</p>

<p>Note that we are defining features that apply to a single word. If a
tense is constructed periphrastically (two or more words,
e.g. auxiliary verb indicative + participle of the main verb) and none
of the participating words are specific to this tense, then the
features will probably not directly reveal the tense. For instance,
[en] <em>I <b>had been</b> there</em> is past perfect (pluperfect) tense,
formed periphrastically by the simple past tense of the auxiliary <em>to
have</em> and the past participle of the main verb <em>to be</em>. The auxiliary
will be tagged <code>VerbForm=Fin|Mood=Ind|Tense=Past</code> and the participle
will have <code>VerbForm=Part|Tense=Past</code>; none of the two will have
<code>Tense=Pqp</code>.  On the other hand, Portuguese can form the pluperfect
morphologically as just one word, which will thus be tagged
<code>VerbForm=Fin|Mood=Ind|Tense=Pqp</code>.</p>

<h3 id="past-past-tense--preterite--aorist"><code>Past</code>: past tense / preterite / aorist</h3>

<p>The past tense denotes actions that happened before the current
moment. In English, this is the simple past form. In German, this is
the Präteritum. In Turkish, this is the non-narrative past.  In
Bulgarian, this is aorist, the aspect-neutral past tense that can be
used freely with both imperfective and perfective verbs (see also
imperfect).</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em>he <b>went</b> home</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pres-present-tense"><code>Pres</code>: present tense</h3>

<p>The present tense denotes actions that are happening right now or that
usually happen.</p>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em>he <b>goes</b> home</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fut-future-tense"><code>Fut</code>: future tense</h3>

<p>The future tense denotes actions that will happen after the current
moment.</p>

<h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[es] <em><b>irá</b> a la casa</em> “he/she/it will go home”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="imp-imperfect"><code>Imp</code>: imperfect</h3>

<p>Used in e.g. Bulgarian and Croatian, imperfect is a special case of
the past tense. Note that, unfortunately, imperfect tense is not
always the same as past tense + imperfective aspect. For instance, in
Bulgarian, there is lexical aspect, inherent in verb meaning, and
grammatical aspect, which does not necessarily always match the
lexical one. In main clauses, imperfective verbs can have imperfect
tense and perfective verbs have perfect tense. However, both rules can
be violated in embedded clauses.</p>

<h3 id="nar-narrative"><code>Nar</code>: narrative</h3>

<p>Special case of the past tense, this is the Turkish <em>miş</em>-past. The
difference is whether the speaker personally witnessed the action he
is describing, or not.</p>

<h3 id="pqp-pluperfect"><code>Pqp</code>: pluperfect</h3>

<p>The pluperfect denotes action that happened before another action in
past. This value does not apply to English where the pluperfect (past
perfect) is constructed analytically. It applies e.g. to Portuguese.</p>

<p><a id="al-u-feat/VerbForm" class="al-dest"></a></p>
<h2><code>VerbForm</code>: form of verb or deverbative</h2>

<p>Even though the name of the feature seems to suggest that it is used
exclusively with <a href="u-pos/VERB">verbs</a>, it is not the case. Some verb
forms in some languages actually form a gray zone between verbs and
other parts of speech (<a href="u-pos/NOUN">nouns</a>, <a href="u-pos/ADJ">adjectives</a>
and <a href="u-pos/ADV">adverbs</a>). For instance, participles may be either
classified as verbs or as adjectives, depending on language and
context. In both cases <code>VerbForm=Part</code> may be used to separate them
from other verb forms or other types of adjectives.</p>

<h3 id="fin-finite-verb"><code>Fin</code>: finite verb</h3>

<p>Rule of thumb: if it has non-empty <a href="">Mood</a>, it is finite. But beware
that some tagsets conflate verb forms and moods into one feature.</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em>I <b>do</b>, he <b>does</b></em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="inf-infinitive"><code>Inf</code>: infinitive</h3>

<p>Infinitive is the citation form of verbs in many languages. Unlike in
English, it often has morphological form that is distinct from the
finite forms. Infinitives may be used together with auxiliaries to
form periphrastic tenses (e.g. future tense [cs] <em>budu <b>sedět</b> v
letadle</em> “I will sit in a plane”), they appear as arguments of modal
verbs etc.  In some languages they behave similarly to nouns and are
used as such (similar to the gerund in English).</p>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[de] _ich muss _<b><em>gehen</em></b> “I must <b>go</b>”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sup-supine"><code>Sup</code>: supine</h3>

<p>Supine is a rare verb form. It survives in some Slavic languages
(Slovenian) and is used instead of infinitive as the argument of
motion verbs (old [cs] <em>jdu <b>spat</b></em> lit. <em>I-go sleep</em>).</p>

<p>A form called “supine” also exists in Swedish where it is a special
form of the participle, used to form the composite past form of a
verb.  It is used after the auxiliary verb <em>ha</em> (to have) but not
after <em>vara</em> (to be):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simple past: I ate (the) dinner = <em>Jag åt maten</em> (using preterite)</li>
  <li>Composite past: I have eaten (the) dinner = <em>Jag har <b>ätit</b> maten</em> (using supine)</li>
  <li>Past participle common: (The) dinner is eaten = <em>Maten är äten</em> (using past participle)</li>
  <li>Past participle neuter: (The) apple is eaten = <em>Äpplet är ätet</em></li>
  <li>Past participle plural: (The) apples are eaten = <em>Äpplena är ätna</em> </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="part-participle"><code>Part</code>: participle</h3>

<p>Participle is a non-finite verb form that shares properties of verbs
and adjectives. Its usage varies across languages. It may be used to
form various periphrastic verb forms such as complex tenses and
passives; it may be also used purely adjectively.</p>

<p>Other features may help to distinguish past/present participles
(English), active/passive participles (Czech), imperfect/perfect
participles (Hindi) etc.</p>

<h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em>he could have <b>been prepared</b> if he had
<b>forseen</b> it</em>; <em>I will be <b>driving</b> home</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="trans-transgressive"><code>Trans</code>: transgressive</h3>

<p>The transgressive, also called adverbial participle, is a non-finite
verb form that shares properties of verbs and adverbs. It appears
e.g. in Slavic and Indo-Aryan languages.</p>

<h4 id="examples-3">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em>zírali na mne, pevně <b>svírajíce</b> své zbraně</em> “they
stared at me <b>while gripping</b> their guns firmly”;
<em><b>udělavši</b> večeři, zavolala rodinu ke stolu</em> “<b>having
prepared</b> the dinner, she called her family to the table”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ger-gerund"><code>Ger</code>: gerund</h3>

<p>Gerund is a non-finite verb form that shares properties of verbs and
nouns. In English it shares the morphological form with present
participle, which may mean that the tagset will not distinguish it
from the participle.</p>

<h4 id="examples-4">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[en] <em>I look forward to <b>seeing</b> you</em>; <em>he turns a blind
eye to my <b>being</b> late</em></li>
</ul>

<p><a id="al-u-feat/Voice" class="al-dest"></a></p>
<h2><code>Voice</code>: voice</h2>

<p>For Indo-European speakers, voice means mainly the active-passive
distinction. In other languages, other shades of verb meaning are
categorized as voice.</p>

<h3 id="act-active-voice"><code>Act</code>: active voice</h3>

<p>The subject of the verb is the doer of the action (agent), the object
is affected by the action (pacient).</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em><b>Napadli</b> jsme nepřítele.</em> “We <b>attacked</b> the enemy”
(the active participle <em>napadli</em> can be used to form either past
tense or conditional mood; here it forms the past tense.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pass-passive-voice"><code>Pass</code>: passive voice</h3>

<p>The subject of the verb is affected by the action (patient). The doer
(agent) is either unexpressed or it appears as an object of the verb.</p>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[cs] <em>Jsme <b>napadeni</b> nepřítelem.</em> “We are <b>attacked</b> by
the enemy” (the passive participle <em>napadeni</em> is used to form
passive in all tenses; here it forms the present passive.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rcp-reciprocal-voice"><code>Rcp</code>: reciprocal voice</h3>

<h4 id="examples-2">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[tr] <em><b>karıştı</b></em>, <em><b>tutuştular</b></em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cau-causative-voice"><code>Cau</code>: causative voice</h3>

<p><a href="https://wiki.ufal.ms.mff.cuni.cz/_media/user:zeman:treebanks:ttbankkl.pdf">Documentation</a>
of the METU Sabanci treebank classifies causative as voice (page 26).
Note that this is a feature of verbs. There are languages that have
also the causative case of nouns.</p>

<h4 id="examples-3">Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[tr] <em><b>karıştırıyor</b></em> “is confusing”</li>
</ul>
