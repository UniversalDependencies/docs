A temporal clause is a subtype of the [advcl]() relation: if the subordinate clause is specifying a time, it is labeled as `tcl`.
This is parallel to [obl:tmod](), which covers temporal modifiers that are realized as nominals,
and [advmod:tmod](), which covers temporal modifiers that are realized as adverbs.
