## Tense

Tense is a feature that specifies the time when the action took / takes / will take place, in relation to the current moment or to another action 
in the utterance.

Pomak verbal forms convey both tense and aspect information, therefore a complete description would specify both Tense and [Aspect]() features.
 
In [Aspect]() the pairs `Aspect=Prog`|`Tense=Past` and `Aspect=Iter`|`Tense=Past` were introduced to describe the fact that Pomak views iterations of 
events in the past either by focussing on their progressive nature or on the telic nature of each or the events in the iteration. 
Τhis description diverges from the one adopted by other Slavic languages (Bulgarian, Kroatian). 

For the description of the present and the simple past tense of Pomak, the pairs 
`Aspect=Imp`|`Tense=Pres`, `Aspect=Imp`|`Tense=Past` are used for the imperfective forms
and the pairs `Aspect=Perf`|`Tense=Pres`, `Aspect=Perf`|`Tense=Past` for the perfective ones respectively.
