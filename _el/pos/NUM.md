### Definition
A numeral is a word functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Cardinal numerals are always assigned the tag [NUM]() whether they are used as determiners or not (as in *Θύρα 7* / *thira 7* "Gate 7") and whether they are expressed as words (*εφτά*), digits (7) or Roman numerals (VΙΙ). 

Νon-cardinal numerals belong to other parts of speech: 
-	ordinal numerals are assigned the tag <code>ADJ</code> (πρώτος, δεύτερος, τρίτος) 
-	multiplicative numerals are assigned the tag <code>ADV</code> (άπαξ, δίπαξ) 

### Examples
-		0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2014, 1000000, 3.14159265359
-	 *ένα, δύο, τρία, εβδομήντα πέντε* "one, two, three, seventy five"
-	I, II, III, IV, V, MMXIV
