In Czech, negation is mostly done using the bound morpheme _ne-,_
and independent negating particle (equivalent to English “not”)
is rarely seen. Words that can take the morpheme of negation have
the feature of negativeness.

It applies to [verbs](cs-pos/VERB),
[adjectives](cs-pos/ADJ), sometimes also [adverbs](cs-pos/ADV) and
even [nouns](cs-pos/NOUN).
(Most nouns have just `Negative=Pos`;
deverbative nouns can have also `Negative=Neg`.)

Note that `Negative=Neg` is not the same thing as
[PronType]()`=Neg`. For pronouns and other pronominal parts of speech
there is no such binary opposition as for verbs and adjectives. (There
is no such thing as “affirmative pronoun”.)

### `Pos`: positive, affirmative

#### Examples

* _<b>přišel</b>&nbsp;_ “he came”
* _<b>rozumný</b>&nbsp;_ “wise”
* _<b>pěkně</b>&nbsp;_ “nicely”
* _<b>přijetí</b>&nbsp;_ “acceptance”

### Neg: negative

#### Examples

* _<b>nepřišel</b>&nbsp;_ “he did not come”
* _<b>nerozumný</b>&nbsp;_ “unwise”
* _<b>nepěkně</b>&nbsp;_ “nastily”
* _<b>nepřijetí</b>&nbsp;_ “non-acceptance, rejection”
