### <a name="Emp">`Emp`</a>: emphatic

There are many ways of marking emphasis in Scottish Gaelic and the morphological one involves the suffixes _-e_, _-ne_, _-sa_, _-se_, _-san_ which are usually applied to pronouns but also to nouns and verbs.

#### Examples

* _mi_ "I/me"
* _mi<b>se</b>_ "I/me (emphatic form)" 
* _dhomh_ "to me"
* _dhomh<b>sa</b>_ "to me (emphatic form)"
* _air mo shon_ "for me"
* _air mo shon-<b>sa</b>_ "for me (emphatic form)"
* _ar n-athraichean_ "our fathers"
* _ar n-athraichean-<b>ne</b>_ "our (emphatic form) fathers"
* _cuireamaid_ "let us put"
* _cuireamaid-<b>ne</b>_ "let us (emphatic form) put"

Note that from UD 2.6 onwards, _dhomh_ and _dhomhsa_ are divided into the underlying words _do_ and _mi_ or _mise_.
