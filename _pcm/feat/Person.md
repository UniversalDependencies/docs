In Naija, Person is typically a feature of personal, possessive and reciprocal
[pronouns](pcm-pos/PRON).

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons. There is no distinction between inclusive and
exclusive 1<SUP>st</SUP> person plural pronouns.

#### Examples

* _<b>I</b> don hear you_ "I heard you"

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the
utterance. In plural, it may mean several addressees and
optionally some third persons too.

#### Examples

* _<b>you</b> go enter Lagos Ibadan expressway_ "you would enter Lagos Ibadan expressway"
* _some of <b>una</b> no know_ "some of you don't know"

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither
speakers nor addressees.

#### Examples

* _one man <b>im</b> dey drive_ "one man, he was driving"
