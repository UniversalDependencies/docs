Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
[verb](mdf-pos/VERB) forms.

### <a name="Cnd">`Cnd`</a>: conditional

The conditional mood is used to express conditions, i.e. protasis, for actions of the main clause. This mood marker can be found in finite and non-finite forms alike, as well as followed by derivational suffixes.

#### Examples

* [mdf] _<b>Касондярян</b>, улян лётчикокс._ "<b>When I grow up</b>, I am going to be a pilot."

### <a name="CndSub">`CndSub`</a>: conditional subjunctive

The conditional subjunctive mood is used to express hypothetical conditions, i.e. protasis, for actions of the main clause. This mood marker can be found in finite and non-finite forms alike, as well as followed by derivational suffixes.

#### Examples

* [mdf] _<b>Путондяряльхть</b> утомня, ..._ "<b>If they were to build</b> an outbuilding, ..."

### <a name="Des">`Des`</a>: desiderative

The desiderative mood is used to express desired or potential actions that are not fulfilled.

#### Examples

* [mdf] _<b>Молелексолеть</b>_ "Did you want to go"

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: indicative

The imperative is used for second person singular and plural.
It is distinguished from the optative and precutive elsewhere documented
as imperative with softening clitic.

#### Examples

* [mdf] _<b>Архт</b>, <b>архт</b> меки общежитияв._ "<b>Go</b>, <b>go</b> back to the dormitory."

### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in the
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* [mdf] _Сон <b>кошардозе</b> мирденц машинань штама._ "She <b>ordered</b> her husband to wash the car."

### <a name="NegCndSub">`NegCndSub`</a>: negative conditional subjunctive

The negative conditional subjunctive mood is used to express hypothetical negative conditions, i.e. protasis, for actions of the main clause.

#### Examples

* [mdf] _аф озадонь седи <b>улефтяряль</b>,_ "<b>If it were not</b> for her being upset, ..."


### <a name="Opt">`Opt`</a>: optative

The optative is used for three persons in two numbers. It expresses a concessive attitude and at time resultative.

#### Examples

* [mdf] _, а матодовондяряй -- <b>кирдест</b> стенатне._ ", but should he/she fall asleep, <b>may</b> the walls <b>hold out</b>."

### <a name="Prec">`Prec`</a>: precutive

The precutive mood is used to express requests instead of commands.

#### Examples

* [mdf] _Да тон <b>варжака</b>, конашкава ляпоня!_ "and you <b>take a look</b> at how soft it is!"

### <a name="Sub">`Sub`</a>: conjunctive (subjunctive)

The conjunctive mood (also subjunctive) is attested in both the main clause and subordinate clauses. It is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen.
The conjunctive is also used to express volition in both proclamations and questions

#### Examples

* [mdf] _Цёранянди <b>шачелеть</b>, сяда кице удалаль,..._ "<b>Had you been born</b> a man, your road would have succeeded better,..."
