This covers a range of compound reduplicated forms or echo words in Armenian. The reduplicative and echo words get the same POS tag as the head word or will be tagged according to their basic use.

See also the related feature [Hyph]().

### <a name="Rdp">`Rdp`</a>: reduplicative

The word is a copy of a previous word. Тhis would add the meaning of distribution, separation, variety, diversity or just emphasis.

#### Examples

* _երկու-<b>երկու</b>_ “two by two”,
* _զույգ-<b>զույգ</b>_ “in pairs”,
* _փունջ-<b>փունջ</b>_ “each bunch separately”,
* _մեծ-<b>մեծ</b>_ “too big”,
* _գույն-<b>գույն</b>_ “of many colors”,
* _պես-<b>պես</b>_ “different, of many types”

In some cases one of the words in reduplicated forms may also be modified individually by other words.

* _ինձ ու <b>ինձ</b>_ “to myself”,
* _րոպե առ <b>րոպե</b>_ “each minute separately”

### <a name="Ech">`Ech`</a>: echo

The word fully or partly rhymes with a previous or following word but it is not identical to it and
typically it does not have any meaning of its own. The echoed part is a form that does not occur elsewhere than in compounds.
In Armenian it generalizes or specifies the meaning of the previous or following word and is translated
as “or something”, “etc.”, “like that” etc.

* _տուն-<b>մուն</b>_ “house and things like that”,
* _աման-<b>չաման</b>_ “dishes and etc.”,
* _<b>առոք</b>-փառոք_ “good and proper”,
* _մարդ-<b>մուրդ</b>_ “some people”,
* _<b>դափ</b>-դատարկ_ “fully empty”,
* _<b>նոփ</b>-նոր_ “fully new”
