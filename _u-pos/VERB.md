### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically
signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a
clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which
may occur in the clause. Verbs are often associated with grammatical
categories like tense, mood, aspect and voice, which can either be
expressed inflectionally or using auxilliary verbs or particles.

Note that the `VERB` tag covers main verbs _(content verbs)_
but it does not cover _auxiliary verbs_ and verbal _copulas_
(in the narrow sense), for which there is
the [AUX]() tag. _Modal verbs_ may be considered `VERB` or `AUX`,
depending on their behavior in the given language. Language-specific
documentation should specify which verbs are tagged `AUX` in which
contexts.

Note that _participles_ are word forms that may share properties and
usage of adjectives and verbs. Depending on language and context, they
may be classified as either `VERB` or [ADJ]().

Note that some verb forms such as _gerunds_ and _infinitives_ may
share properties and usage of nouns and verbs. Depending on language
and context, they may be classified as either `VERB` or [NOUN]().

Note that there are verb forms such as _converbs (transgressives)_ or _adverbial
participles_ that share properties and usage of adverbs and
verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as
either `VERB` or [ADV]().
