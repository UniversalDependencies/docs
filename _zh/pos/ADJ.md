### Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes. They may also function as predicates. These include the categories known as 區別詞 / _qūbiécí_ and 形容詞 / _xíngróngcí_.

- <b>好</b> 風景 / _<b>hǎo</b> fēngjǐng_ "good scenery"
- 天氣 很 <b>好</b> / _tiānqì hěn <b>hǎo</b>_ "The weather is good."

The adjective may be accompanied by the particle 的 / _de_ when functioning as a prenominal modifier (for either 區別詞 / _qūbiécí_ or 形容詞 / _xíngróngcí_), and obligatorily when functioning as a predicate if it is a 區別詞 / _qūbiécí_. 

- <b>美麗</b> 的 風景 / _<b>měilì</b> de fēngjǐng_ "beautiful scenery"
- 這 隻 鳥 是 <b>雌</b> 的 / _zhè zhī niǎo shì <b>cí</b> de_ "This bird is female." 

Note that ordinal numerals such as 第一 / _dìyī_ "first" and 第三 / _dìsān_ "third" are to be treated as adjectives and tagged `ADJ` _per_ UD specifications, even though they are traditionally classified as numerals in Chinese.

### Examples

- 形容詞 / _xíngróngcí_
  - typically can be pre-modified by degree adverbs, like 好 / _hǎo_ "very", and the negator 不 / _bù_, can be post-modified by aspect markers, like 了 / _le_, but cannot take object.

- 區別詞 / _qūbiécí_
  - can pre-modify nouns directly and can be pre-modified by the negator 非 / _fēi_ but cannot be modified by degree adverbs.
  - 金 / _jīn_ "gold(en)", 男 / _nán_ "male", 慢性 / _mànxìng_ "slow acting"
