A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and
expresses a semantic relationship between them.

Conjuctions borrowed from French, such as mɛ́ (mais), épi (et puis) etc., are often used in oral speech.

For _subordinating conjunctions,_ see [SCONJ]().
