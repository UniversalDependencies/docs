`Neutral=Yes` is currently used in the GJA treebank to signal the neutral marker suffix. 


### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: the word contains a neutral marker suffix.

The neutral marker suffix is _-y_. If the ending of the word is a vowel, the _-y_ is attached (For example, _pila_ "how much/how many" to _pilay_). If the ending of the word is a consonant, a morphological process is done to accommodate the _-y_ (For example, _pud_ "too/also" to _puy_).

#### Example

* _Naa<b>y</b> tao sa opisina._ “There are people at the office.” (The neutral marker suffix is attached to _Naa_, in this case a verb to denote existence of _tao_ "people", this _Naa_ becomes _Naay_. )
