The _advcl:lto_ relation is used for adverbal clause modifiers with locative to, i.e. direction to modality.
This is distinguished from other locative dependency relations advcl:lmod, advcl:lfrom and advcl:lmp, as well as
 advmod:lmod, advmod:lfrom and advmod:lmp, which generally indicate locative, source and path, respectively.
