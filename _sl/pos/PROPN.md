### Definition

A proper noun is a noun that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object and is usually written with an initial uppercase letter. 

Names sometimes consist of lexical words that can also belong to other part-of-speech categories. For personal and place names in Slovenian, the PROPN tag is used (e.g. surname _<b>Mlinar</b>_ "Miller", village _<b>Brdo</b>_ "Hill") regardless. However, in organizations and other names, the component words retain their original tags. For example, the noun _delo_ "work" in _Delo_ newspaper, the adjective _združen_ "united" in _Združene države_ "United states", etc.

Acronyms of proper nouns, such as _<b>UN</b>_ and _<b>NATO</b>_, are also tagged PROPN, even if they contain numbers (e.g. _<b>X5</b>_).
 
### Examples

- _Slovenija_ "Slovenia"
- _Evropa_ "Europe"
- _ZDA_ "USA"
- _Janez_ (personal names)
- _Olimpija_ (name of sport club)
- _Krka_ (name of river and company)
