Person[psor]
is possessor's person, marked on Hungarian nouns. These noun
forms would be translated to English as possessive pronoun + noun.

This layered feature is conveniently used for possessive inflections
of nouns, although nouns normally do not have a `Person` feature,
meaning that no other layers are needed. Nevertheless, the possessive
morphology typically also includes `Number`, which must be multi-layered
on nouns, and we thus have `Person[psor]` together with `Number[psor]`.

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person possessor

#### Examples

* [myv] _киска_ “dog”
* [myv] _<b>кискам</b>_ “my dog”
* [myv] _<b>кисканок</b>_ “our dog/dogs”

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person possessor

#### Examples

* [myv] _киска_ “dog”
* [myv] _<b>кискат</b>_ “your.Sing dog/dogs”
* [myv] _<b>кисканк</b>_ “your.Plur dog/dogs”

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person possessor

#### Examples

* [myv] _киска_ “dog”
* [myv] _<b>кисказо</b>_ “his/her/its dog”
* [myv] _<b>кискаст</b>_ “their dog/dogs”
