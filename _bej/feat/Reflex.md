Boolean feature, typically of [pronouns](u-pos/PRON). It tells whether the word is reflexive,
i.e. refers to the subject of its clause.


### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is reflexive

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not reflexive, the
`Reflex` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT`
column. (Which means that empty value has the `No` meaning.)

#### Examples
- _kina_ (pronoun which can be translated by "owner")
