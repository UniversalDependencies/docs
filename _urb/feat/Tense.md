The only `Tense` morphologically marked is the [Future tense](https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/Tense.html#Fut), 
marked by the particle *ta*. The distinction between present and past tense can only be inferred from the context. 
Thus, in terms of tense, Ka'apor is a future/non-future language.


### <a name="Fut">`Fut`</a>: Future tense

The example below has the root *ta* indicating the plural number.

#### Examples

* _<b>u-ʔu-ta</b>&nbsp;_ “He will eat” (3-eat-FUT)
* _<b>u-ʔu</b>&nbsp;_ “He eats / he ate” (3-eat)





## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
