### Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes. They may also function as predicates, as in

_El coche es <b>verde</b>._ "The car is green."

In Spanish, adjectives normally follow the noun, e.g. _La casa <b>amarilla</b>_ "The yellow house", although sometimes they may also precede the noun, e.g. _La <b>blanca</b> nieve_ "The white snow".

Adjectives in Spanish agree in number and gender with the noun they modify, e.g. _la casa <b>amarilla</b>_ (femenine singular), _las casas <b>amarillas</b>_ (femenine plural).

The class of adjectives in Spanish UD also includes _ordinal numbers_ and _participial adjectives_, both behaving as adjectives morphologically and syntactically. Note that _participles_ are word forms that may share properties and usage of adjectives and verbs. Depending on context, they may be classified as either [VERB]() or ADJ.

To conform to the UD guidelines, possessive adjectives are handled as determiners [DET]().

### Examples

* _grande_ "big"
* _viejo_ "old"
