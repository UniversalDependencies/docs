### Description

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real
part-of-speech category. X is typically used for foreign language material or
other un-processable data.

It is foreseeable that in many Uralic language data code-switching is more
common, for treebanks that are not studying code switching, we recommend X for
foreign words unless they can be seen as citation loans (e.g. with native
inflectional suffixes).

#### Examples

* [fi] _cookie_, _open-source_
