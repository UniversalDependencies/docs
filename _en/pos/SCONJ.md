`SCONJ` is used for these two subclasses of subordinating conjunctions:

* Complementizers: _that_, _whether_, _if_, etc.
* Adverbial clause introducers: _when_, _since_, _before_, etc. (when introducing a clause not a nominal)

These are a subset of the things that the IN tag is used for in the PTB.

We treat the putative relativizer use of _that_ (e.g., Jespersen 1924) as a relative pronoun in modern English, so that it gets the POS tag [PRON]().
