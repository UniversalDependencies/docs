Poss is a boolean feature of some determiners in Swedish, indicating whether it is possessive or not.

### `Yes`: it is possessive

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not possessive, the
`Poss` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT` column. 

#### Examples

* _min_ (common singular), _mitt_ (neuter singular), _mina_ (plural) "my"
* _vars_ "whose"
