<!-- DZ: Similar constituents are attached as `obj:agent` in other languages. Wolof should use the same. -->

In a causative construction the `obj:caus` relation attaches the agent to the verb, when the former is the
syntactic object of the sentence (this initial agent has been demoted and became the object of the causative construction).
