`Link=Yes` is currently used in the GJA treebank to signal the linker suffix. Linkers are also shown as separate syntactic words and the surface word is treated as a multi-word token.


### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: the word contains a linker

#### Examples

* _Intelihente ang lalaki<b>ng</b> nagabasa ug libro.__ “The man who reads a libro is intelligent.” (The linker links the noun
  _lalaki_ “man” with the relative clause _nagabasa ug libro_ “reads a book”. The word _lalaking_ will have `Link=Yes`.)
