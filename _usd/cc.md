## cc: coordination

A coordination is the relation between an element of a conjunct and
the coordinating conjunction word of the conjunct.  (Note: different
dependency grammars have different treatments of coordination.  We
take one conjunct of a conjunction (normally the first) as the head of
the conjunction.) A conjunction may also appear at the beginning of a
sentence.  This is also called a cc, and it depends on the root
predicate of the sentence.

<div class="sd-parse">
And then we left .
cc(left, And)
</div>
