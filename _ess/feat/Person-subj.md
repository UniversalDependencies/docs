The Yupik verb inflects for the person (and number) of subject. If subject is provided as a separate noun, it agrees with the verb ending in person (and number).

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person subject

#### Examples

* [ess] _<b>Aqiigukung</b>_  "<b>We went on a long trip</b>." The verb ending _-kung_ `Number[subj]=Dual|Person[subj]=1` encodes that the subject is first person dual ("we, dual").

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person subject

#### Examples

* [ess] _<b>Sanaqsin</b>?_ "What are you going to do?" The verb ending _-sin_ `Number[subj]=Sing|Person[subj]=2` encodes that the subject is second person singular ("you").

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person subject

#### Examples

* [ess] _Sameng atan <b>ivaghta</b>?_ "What did your father look for?" The verb ending _-ta_ `Number[subj]=Sing|Person[subj]=3` in the verb _ivaghta_ "what did he look for" agrees with the subject _atan_ "your father" in person (and number).
