`Mood` has the four following possible values for French, on finite verb forms:

### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* _Tu le <b>fais</b>._ "You <b>do</b> it."

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.

#### Examples

* _<b>Fais</b> le!_ "<b>Do</b> it!"

### <a name="Cnd">`Cnd`</a>: conditional

The conditional mood is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen.

#### Examples

* _Je le <b>ferais</b>._ "I <b>would do</b> it."

### <a name="Sub">`Sub`</a>: subjunctive

The subjunctive mood is used under certain circumstances in
subordinate clauses, typically for actions that are subjective or
otherwise uncertain.

#### Examples

* _Je veux que tu le <b>fasses</b>._ "I want you to do it." lit. _I want that you it do._
