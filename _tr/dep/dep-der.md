Turkish has two types of -ki suffix: Pronominal -ki and
Adjectival -ki. The main difference between these two
is the fact that numerous inflectional morphemes can occur
before adjectival -ki. Regarding derivational morphemes as
opaque causes a loss of significant information. Hence 
splitting adjectival -ki from its stem allows more in-depth
annotations. 


We use dep:der relation to connect the splitted adjectival
-ki to its stem:
The stem hosting adjectival -ki is annotated as a NOUN,
adjectival -ki is connected to the stem as its dependent.
