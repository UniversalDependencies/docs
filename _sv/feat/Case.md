Case is usually an inflectional feature of [nouns](sv-pos/NOUN), helping to specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence. Swedish makes use of three cases: nominative, accusative, and genitive. The accusative is found only in 
pronouns (PRON), while the nominative/genitive distinction occurs with nouns (NOUN), proper nouns (PROPN) 
and adjectives (ADJ).

### `Nom`: nominative

The base form, typically used as a citation form (lemma).

#### Examples

* [sv] _att ta <b>ansvar</b>_ "to take <b>responsibility</b>"
* [sv] _<b>riskerna</b> är stora_ "the <b>risks</b> are large"

### `Acc`: accusative

In many languages used for direct objects of verbs. In Swedish this form is only used for personal pronouns.

#### Examples

* [sv] _du behöver <b>dem</b>_ "you need <b>them</b>"
* [sv] _ta med <b>dig</b>_ "take with <b>you</b>"

### `Gen`: genitive

Prototypical meaning of genitive is that the noun phrase somehow belongs to its governor; it would often be translated by the English preposition _of_. The genitive in Swedish does not however always imply possession, for example _<b>Stillhetens</b> hav_ "Sea of <b>Tranquility</b>"

#### Examples

* [sv] _<b>eftermiddagens</b> övningar_ "the <b>afternoon's</b> exercises"
* [sv] _<b>patientens</b> ekonomi_ "the <b>patient's</b> finances"
