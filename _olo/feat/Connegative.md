Boolean feature of verbs ([VERB]() and [AUX]()), marking a word as
being in connegative form.

In Livvi, negations are formed of the auxiliary negative verb (*ei*)
and the main verb, the latter of which typically appears in
connegative form.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: word is connegative

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not connegative, the
`Connegative` feature will not appear.

#### Examples

* [fi] _en <b>tahton</b>_ "I don't <b>want</b>"
* [olo] _Rahvas ei <b>kylmetty</b viluhkos kul’tuurutalois._ "The people were not <b>frozen</b> in a bustle of cultural houses."
