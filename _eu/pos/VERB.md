A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically
signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a
clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which
may occur in the clause. 

The tag VERB is reserved for full lexical verbs, while auxiliary verbs are tagged [AUX]. In Basque, there are two types of main verbs: 

* Complete: verbs with aspect, tense, and agreement features
* Incomplete: verbs with aspect and tense features (future tense)

### Examples

- Complete: _<b>daramat</b>_ "(I) <b>carry</b> (it)", _<b>dakarkio</b>_ "(he) <b>brings</b>(present-tense) (it) (to him)"
- Incomplete: _<b>ekarri</b> du(AUX)_ "<b>carry</b> him-it-present-tense(AUX)",
