In Bamana, the majority of adpositions are postpositions. Postpositions can be divided into simple (mà 'to, by someone')  and complex ones (kɔ́fɛ̀ 'behind, litt: back on'). Prepositons include fɔ́ 'till', kábini 'since' and 'ní'. All prepositions can function as subordinate conjunction as well, for more information see [case](bm:dep/case).
