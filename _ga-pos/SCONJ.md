#### Description

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other.

In Irish, subordinate conjunctions normally precede a subordinate clause marker such as _go_, _a_. 

There is also a special case of using _agus_ "and" (normally `CONJ`) as a subordinate conjunction, where the subordinate clause is missing a surface verb `to be', yet will have a subject in use with a progressive aspectual phrase, an adjective, a past participle  or locative adverb.


#### Examples

* _nuair_ "when"
* _tháinig sí ar ais <b>nuair</b> a chuala sí an nuacht_ "she came back <b>when</b> she heard the news"
* _cé_ "even though"
* _<b>cé</b> go raibh cuid mhaith ann san am gcéanna_ "<b>even though</b> there was a lot there at the same time"
* _sula_/_sular_ "before"
* _<b>sular</b> féidir linn imeacht, ní mór dúinn léarscáil a cheannach_ "<b>before</b> we leave, we need to buy a map"
* _Seo pictúir a tógadh dhó <b>agus</b> é briste_ "here picture that was taken of it <b>and</b> it broken"
