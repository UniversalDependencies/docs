### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned
a real part-of-speech category.

Particular uses of the `X` tag are false starts characteristic of oral speech, swallowing noises and phono-morphological linkers. 

### Examples

- _a- skʷi <b>-i</b> a- gʷoːj =t // hoːj ɖaːb -ja <b>-i</b> iː- ha //_ I chased him, and I could not (catch up with him), and  he run away from there. (linker)
- _<b>kaː#</b> oːn oːn dammʔarawoː ikamiheːda /_ he puts his gold on his camels and his donkey and he brings it  back, they said. (False start)
