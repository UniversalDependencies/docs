Definiteness is typically a feature of nouns, adjectives and
articles. Its value distinguishes whether we are talking about
something known and concrete, or something general or unknown. In Portuguese, this feature applies only to determiners.
It can be marked on definite and indefinite [articles](pt-pos/DET).

### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indefinite

#### Examples

### <a name="Def">`Def`</a>: definite

#### Examples
