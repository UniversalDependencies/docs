The object of a verb is the second most core argument of a verb after the subject. 
Typically, it is the noun phrase that denotes the entity acted upon or which undergoes a change of state or motion (the proto-patient).
The object in Bulgarian corresponds to the position of the "Accusative" case, 
since nominals in Bulgarian do not have declension.

Accusative example:

~~~ sdparse
Купувам му къща . \n Buy-I him house .
obj(Купувам, къща)
obj(Buy-I, house)
~~~
