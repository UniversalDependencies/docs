A dependency is labeled as `dep` when a more precise dependency relation between two words cannot be determined.
This may be because of a weird grammatical construction, a limitation in software, a parser error, or because of an unresolved long distance dependency.

In French corpora, it is used for instance for euphonic element like *t* in:

~~~ sdparse
Que se passe -t -il ? \n What happens?
dep(-il,-t)
~~~
