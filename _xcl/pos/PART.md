### Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech. Particles may encode grammatical categories such as negation, mood, tense etc.
 
In UD_Classical_Armenian-CAVaL, the tag is used restrictively when no other tag is applicable. Other words, which are termed as particles in the tranditional grammar of Classical Armenian are tageed as adverbs, determiners, and conjunctions.

### Examples

* Emphatic particle: իսկ/_isk_
* Negation particle: ոչ/_očՙ_ (and its proclitic variant չ=/_čՙ_=), մի/_mi_
* Mood particle: գուցէ/_gowcՙē_, եթե/_etՙe_ (and its variant թե/_tՙe_)
