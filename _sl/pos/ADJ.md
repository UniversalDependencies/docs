### Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes. Adjectives in Slovenian normally agree in gender, case and number with the noun they modify (both in attributive and predicative position), e.g. _<b>velik</b> škandal_ "a big scandal" (masculine nominative singular), _v <b>velikih</b> podjetjih_ "in big companies" (neuter locative plural) and _Ponudba je <b>velika</b>._ "The offer is big." (feminine nominative singular). 

In accordance with the universal description of `ADJ`, some words that have traditionally been categorized as numerals in Slovenian are also treated as adjectives, as they display similar morphological and syntactic properties. These include ordinal written numerals (e.g. _<b>prvi</b>_ "the first", _<b>drugi</b>_ "the second", _<b>tretji</b>_, "the third") and tuples (e.g. _<b>enojen</b>_ "single", _<b>dvojen</b>_ "double", _<b>trojen</b>_ "triple").

In the same way, all adjectival participles are classified as adjectives, regardless of whether they are used as attributes (e.g. _<b>prepovedane</b> substance_ "forbidden substances"), in copula constructions (e.g. _kajenje je <b>prepovedano</b>_ "smoking is forbidden") or in passive constructions (e.g. _to ji je bilo <b>prepovedano</b>_ "it was forbidden to her").

### Examples

- _star_ "old", _zelen_ "green", _nerazumljiv_ "incomprehensible"
- _človekov_ "human's", _Nobelov_ "Nobel's", _kalcijev_ "calcium's"
- _znan_ "known", _zaposlen_ "employed", _povezan_ "connected"
- _prvi_ "first", _drugi_ "second", _tretji_ "third"
- _enojen_ "single", _dvojen_ "double", _trojen_ "triple"

#### Conversion from JOS

All adjectives are converted to `ADJ`. In addition to that, some numerals also become `ADJ`, namely: numerals with Form=letter and Type=ordinal; numeral with Form=letter, Type=pronominal and lemma _drug_; numerals with Form=letter, Type=special and lemma ending in _-en_.
