### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner,
adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the
number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Note that cardinal numerals are covered by `NUM` whether they are used
as determiners or not (as in _Windows <b>Sete</b>_) and whether they
are expressed as words _(quatro)_, digits _(4)_ or Roman numerals
_(IV)_. Other words functioning as determiners (including quantifiers
such as _muito_ and _pouco_) are tagged [DET]().

Note that there are words that may be traditionally called numerals in
some languages (e.g. Czech and Portuguese) but which are not tagged `NUM`. 
Such non-cardinal numerals belong to other parts of speech in the universal
tagging scheme, based mainly on syntactic criteria. 
These are [adjectives](ADJ) _(primeiro, segundo, terceiro)_ (ordinal numerals) 
or [adverbs](ADV) (_mais_uma_vez_ "once more"; _pela_primeira_vez_ "for the first time").

### Examples

- _0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2014, 1000000, 3.14159265359_
- _um, dois, três, trinta e sete_
- _I, II, III, IV, V, MMXIV_
