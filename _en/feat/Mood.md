In English, `Mood` is a feature of [finite](VerbForm) [verbs](en-pos/Verb). It is used to express modality and further subclassify finite verb forms.

### `Ind`: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* _He <b>makes</b> a sandwich._

### `Imp`: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.

#### Examples

* _<b>Make</b> a sandwich!_

### `Sub`: subjunctive

The subjunctive mood is used under certain circumstances in
subordinate clauses, typically for actions that are subjective or
otherwise uncertain such as expressing an opinion or describing one's state of mind. It is also used to make statements contrary to fact.

* _I suggest that he <b>see</b> a doctor._
* _If I <b>were</b> rich..._

(Note that there is currently no reliable way of identifying subjunctive verbs in an automatic way and therefore we currently also mark present subjunctive verbs as [infinitives](VerbForm) and past subjunctive verbs as past indicative verbs.)
