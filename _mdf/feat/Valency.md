Valency is a language specific feauture for Moksha, as transitivity of a verb might only be observed in the form of the verb when the object is contextually elided.

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: intransitive verb (1 argument)

#### Examples

* _Тонафнись <b>якась</b> вири._ “The student went to the forest.”

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: transitive verb (2 arguments)

The subject-object conjugation generally indicates the presence of a definite object, so some sentences will also have indefinite objects with correlating subject conjugation.

#### Examples

* _Шабась <b>сивозе</b> марть._ “The child ate the apple.”

* _Шабась <b>сивсь</b> марь._ “The child ate an apple.”
