The following English words (only) are currently being treated as `PART` in English:

* Possessive marker: _’s_ or _’_ (and non-standard forms _s_, _-s_)
* Predicate negation: _not_, _n’t_, _nt_
* Infinitive marker: _to_ (and non-standard forms _ta_, _na_, _too_, _ot_, _2_, _a_)

(This is a slightly motley list and we may still want to rethink this category for English....)

This covers PTB tags POS and some (old PTB style) or all uses of TO, and the subset of RB that is negation.
