### Definition

A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or
part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object.

Note that `PROPN` is only used for the subclass of nouns that are used
as names and that often exhibit special syntactic properties.
When other phrases or sentences are used as names, 
the component words retain their original tags.
For example, in _Татарстан Республикасы Милли музее_ "National Museum of the Republic of Tatarstan", 
only _Татарстан_ "Tatarstan" is marked as `PROPN`;
_Республикасы_ "republic" is tagged as `NOUN`, _Милли_ "national" as `ADJ`, _музее_ "museum" as `NOUN`.

Acronyms of proper nouns, such as _РФ_ and _ТР_, should be tagged `PROPN`.

### Examples

- _Марат_, _Гөлнара_
- _Казан_
- _ТР_, _РФ_, _АКШ_
