Latvian features gender for adjectives ([`ADJ`]()) and ordinal numerals and some participles ([`VERB`]() with [`VerbForm=Part`](VerbForm)).

Values used:

* `Ind` (indefinite)
* `Def` (definite)

Theoretically possible values:

* `Spec` (specific indefinite) - in contemporary language ordinal numbers feature definite ending, e. g., _trešais_ "third", _ceturtais_ "fourth", however dictionaries and older teksts sometimes contain ordinal number forms with indefinite ending, e.g., _trešs_, _ceturts_. This is rare enough to be absent from corpus.

Values not present in Latvian:

* `Cons` (reducedconstruct state)
* `Com` (complex)
