This is a subtype of [aux](), used for the conditional auxiliary _ба_.

The conditional auxiliary, when attached to a predicate,
typically carries the conditional modality found in finite verbal forms but not non-finites.
In meaning this correlates with the UD subjunctive mood `Mood=Sub' and may co-occur with it.
