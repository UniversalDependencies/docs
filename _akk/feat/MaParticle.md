Encodes whether the form has the -_mā_ clitic. In Old Babylonian this particle is observed to mark clause-level contrast and word-level contrastive focus, among other things. The exact range of functions it fulfills in Neo-Assyrian and other later dialects of Akkadian has not been well-studied. As a result, in the MCONG treebank we label it with the feature MaParticle.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: has the -mā clitic.

#### Examples
* _šarru<b>mā</b> ina ekalli_ “the _king_ (and not someone else) is in the palace”
* _ana āli nillik<b>mā</b> mamma ul nīmur_ “We went to the city but we didn't see anyone”
