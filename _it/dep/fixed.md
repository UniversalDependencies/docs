The <code>fixed</code> relation is one of the three relations for multiword expressions (MWEs)
(the other two being [flat]() and [compound]()). 
It is used for certain fixed grammaticized expressions that behave
like function words or short adverbials.
Any grammatical class can take part in a multiword expression, but usually they are a combination of adverbials and prepositions (usually *a* or *di*).

Some of the most common <code>fixed</code> cases for Italian are listed in the examples below.
