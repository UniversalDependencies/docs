The Hebrew [verbs](he-pos/VERB) `if` (`יש`) and `ain` (`אין`), as well as their inflections such as `ifnm` (`ישנם`), are used in existential sentences which are formed in a way that is atypical to Hebrew syntax: the possessee acts as syntactic subject and follows the verb. For this reason, and to differentiate from their other functions (such as modal verbs), they are marked with the single attribute value `True`.

### `True`: existential form

This verb is the predicate of an existential clause.

#### Examples:

* <b>יש</b> נמלים בגינה _<b>if</b> nmlim bginh_ "There are ants in the garden"
* לקבוצה <b>אין</b> סיכוי השנה _lqbvch <b>ain</b> sikvi hfnh_ "The team doesn't have a chance this year"
