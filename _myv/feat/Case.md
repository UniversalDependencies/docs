### `Nom`: nominative

The base form, typically used as a citation form (lemma).
The nominative form is used in the morphosyntactic funtion of subject and predicate. While the definite declension usually indicates topic (subject) function, the indefinite declension often appears in presentation of new information, such as in existential sentences. Possessor indexing on the nominative allows for both interpretations.

The indefinite nominative singular is one of the complement forms for postpositional constructions; the others being the indefinite and definite genitive forms.

The indefinite nominative singular and plural are used as indefinite object forms; the others being the indefinite and definite genitive forms.

#### Examples

* [myv] _шабрасо од <b>киска</b>_ "there is a new <b>dog</b> at the neighbor's"
* [myv] _монь од <b>псакам</b>_ "I have a new <b>cat</b>"
* [myv] _<b>кискась</b> чийни_ "<b>the dog</b> is running around"

### `Gen`: genitive

The genitive in Erzya indicates the possessor. It is also one of the morphological markers for direct object and adpositional complement.
In the indefinite declension the genitive, when attached to words with material source or origin referents, the resulting form is considered by many grammarians as an adjectival derivation form. 

#### Examples

* [myv] _<b>минек</b> кудонок_ "<b>our</b> house" 
* [myv] _<b>минек</b> кудось_ "<b>our</b> house" (often contrastive by nature, i.e. not your house.)
* [myv] _андынек <b>кисканть</b>_ "we fed <b>the dog</b>" 
* [myv] _кискась пансь <b>псаканть</b> мельга_ "the dog chased after <b>the cat</b>" 

### `Abl`: ablative

In Erzya the ablative case is used to  express (1)  standard of comparison, (2) theme of discussion, (3)  manipulation point of the direct object, (4) in quantification of the object with verbs of `consumption` eat, drink and breath, (5) beginning of path...


#### Examples

* [myv] _<b>Нюрадо</b> сэрей_ "taller <b>than Nyura</b>"
* [myv] _кортыть <b>Инечиде</b>_ "they are talking <b>about Easter</b>"
* [myv] _саизе эйкакшонть <b>кедте</b>_ "She took the child <b>by the hand</b>"
* [myv] _ней лекси ванькс <b>коштто</b>_ "now it is breathing fresh <b>air</b>"
