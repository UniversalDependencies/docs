## INTJ: interjection 

### Definition

An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation. It typically expresses an emotional reaction, is not syntactically related to other accompanying expressions, and may include a combination of sounds not otherwise found in the language.

Note that words primarily belonging to another part of speech retain their original category when they are used in exclamations. For example, the exclamation *Παναγία μου!* / *Panagia mou!* "My Virgin Mary!" is assigned the tags [PROPN]() and [PRON]() in that order.  

As a special case of interjection, we recognize feedback particles such as *yes*, *no*, *uhuh*, etc.  *Όχι* / *ochi* "no/not" is typically used as an interjection [INTJ]() with [Polarity=Neg]() but it should be tagged as [PART]() with [Polarity=Neg]() if it is used like the English particle *not*, e.g., *φέρε τον αναπτήρα, όχι τα σπίρτα* / *fere ton anaptira, ochi ta spirta* "fetch the lighter, not the matches".

### Examples

-	*αμήν*
-	*άντε*
-	*βρε*
-	*καλέ*
-	*ναι*, [INTJ]() with [Polarity=Pos]()
-	*όχι*, [INTJ]() with [Polarity=Neg]()
-	*ορίστε*
-	*μα*
-	*λοιπόν*
-	*καλημέρα*
-	*καληνύχτα*
