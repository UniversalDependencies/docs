Welsh has only a definit article, which is identical for both genders and both numbers. Its form depends on context:
* _yr_: in front of vowels: _yr afal_ "the apple"
* _'r_: after a word ending with a vowel: _Mae'r dyn hwn yn gryf_ "this man is strong"
* _y_: in all other cases: _Mi welais y dyn_ "I saw the man"
