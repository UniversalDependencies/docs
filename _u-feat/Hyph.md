Boolean feature. Is this part of a hyphenated compound? Depending on
tokenization, the compound may be one token or be split to several
tokens; then the tokens need tags.

These are words corresponding to prefixes such `inter-` (inter disciplinary), `post-` (post traumatic), `un-` (un avoidable), `di-` (di transitive) and so on in English, but which are
relized as distinct tokens (without the hyphen) in different languages.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is part of hyphenated compound

Examples: "anglo-" in "anglo-saxon"; [cs] "česko-slovenský"
(Czecho-Slovak; the second part is a normal adjective, including
adjectival morphological paradigm, but the first part is special.)
