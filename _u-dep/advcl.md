An adverbial clause modifier is a clause which modifies a verb or other predicate (adjective, etc.),
as a modifier not as a core complement. This includes things such as a temporal clause, consequence, conditional clause, purpose
clause, etc. The dependent must be clausal (or else it is an [advmod]()) and the dependent is the main predicate of the clause.
