## UD-maintained tools

The Universal Dependencies project maintains a number of core tools for working with UD data.
These tools are available from <https://github.com/universaldependencies/tools> and briefly
described below.

* [Specification for converters and validators for v2](v1_to_v2.html)

### Annotation statistics

There are two scripts that compute statistics, one written in Python and one in Perl. Despite similar names they are not equivalent!

<pre>
python conllu-stats.py -h
python conllu-stats.py --stats ../UD_English/en-ud-train.conllu

perl conllu-stats.pl --help
</pre>

The Perl script can be run in two main modes. In the default mode, it generates a XML file with statistics, including all tags, features and relations. This file is generated by the release team for every released treebank and the file <code>stats.xml</code> is then part of the release. The script is typically invoked from the treebank folder:

<pre>
cat *.conllu | perl conllu-stats.pl > stats.xml
</pre>

In the other mode, the script generates much more detailed statistics, which are then automatically included at appropriate places of the language-specific documentation. In this case the script needs to know where are all the treebank repositories and where is the <code>docs</code> repository. It will process all treebanks of one language in one run because there is only one docs section per language. It will write the statistics to the <code>docs</code> repository, which must be switched to the <code>pages-source</code> branch and must be afterwards pushed back to Github. This is usually also done at release time for all languages.

<pre>
perl conllu-stats.pl --detailed --data .. --docs ../docs --lang pt
</pre>

### Consistency checking

(Description TODO)

### Data validation

Validation of UD released treebanks is done using the script `validate.py` from the `tools` repository. More details are given
on the [release checklist page](/release_checklist.html#validation).

### Format conversion

See [Issue 376](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/376) for references to software that helps with migration
of treebanks from [UD v1](http://universaldependencies.org/docsv1/) to v2 guidelines.



## Third-party tools



### Annotation Tools

#### brat rapid annotation tool

<img style="width: 40%; float:right" src="http://universaldependencies.org/img/brat.png"/>
**brat** is a browser-based tool for text annotation. The brat [visualization](visualization.html) component is used in the [UD documentation system](https://spyysalo.github.io/annodoc/) and the tool comes with a [custom configuration](https://github.com/nlplab/brat/tree/master/configurations/Universal-Dependencies) allowing it to be used for UD annotation .

* Category: manual annotation tool
* Platform: any (browser-based)
* Implementation: Python (server), JavaScript (client)
* License: MIT (open source)
* Homepage: <http://brat.nlplab.org/>
* References: [Stenetorp et al. (2012)](http://anthology.aclweb.org/E/E12/E12-2021.pdf)


#### WebAnno

WebAnno is a general purpose web-based annotation tool  for a wide range of linguistic annotations including various layers of morphological, syntactical, and semantic annotations. Additionaly, custom annotation layers can be defined, allowing WebAnno to be used also for non-linguistic annotation tasks. WebAnno targets annotation teams in which all annotators work independently from each other. The tool includes facilities for curating/merging the annotations from multiple annotators, calculating inter-annotator agreement, and project management. Additional features include a correction and automation mode as well as decent support for right-to-left languages.

Since version 3.0.0, WebAnno supports importing and exporting data in the CoNLL-U format. If the data contains sub-token annotations, then the text is obtained from the subtokens and the surface text is added as annotations. To control which column dependencies end up in, the `flavor` feature of the built-in dependency layer needs to be used. If the feature is set to `enchanced`, then it goes to the enhanced dependencies column, otherwise to the basic dependencies column. It is currently up to the annotator to ensure that the dependency trees are well-formed and representable in CoNLL-U, otherwise export to CoNLL-U may fail.

WebAnno 3.0.0 does not support the CoNLL-U 2.0 format at this time.

#### Arborator

<img style="float:right" src="http://universaldependencies.org/img/arborator.PNG"/>
**Arborator** is a manual dependency annotation tool supporting editing of POS tags and dependency relations in an easy to use drag and drop interface. It has project management features including specialized class-sourcing features, such as mixing in small amounts of gold data for evaluation/grading and assigning tasks to annotators. It supports color schemes for different labels and can read and write conll format dependencies. It now supports conllu input as well. There is also a 'quick mode' that can be used without setting up a project, just be copy-pasting conll data. For a demo, see here: <https://arborator.ilpga.fr/q.cgi>

#### TrUDucer

[TrUDucer](http://nats.gitlab.io/truducer/) is a tree rewriting system based on tree transducers.  It transforms dependency trees in a top-down fashion, making sure that each resulting structure will still be a valid tree.  Rules are written in a domain-specific language; for cases where the DSL is not powerfui enough, rules can be augmented by writing special-case predicates in [groovy](http://groovy-lang.org).
It contains an interactive transformation viewer to debug rule applications and a search tool to find trees where a specific rule could be applicable.  As of 2018, TrUDucer is under active development at Hamburg University.

An example rule file converting (large parts of) the Hamburg Dependency Treebank to UD is provided with TrUDucer. The Univerity of Zurich provides a [rule file to convert the TIGER treebank to UD using TrUDucer](https://gitlab.cl.uzh.ch/siclemat/tigerdep2ud).

DepEdit is a simple, open source, configurable tool for manipulating dependency trees, written in Python (2/3). It can be run standalone from the commandline or imported as a module, and it is available on PyPI (`pip install depedit`). Main features:

  * Identify target subtrees based on regex matching of token attributes, distance between tokens, and subgraph edges
  * Change token attributes (incl. text, pos, morph, etc.)
  * Use regex capturing groups in find/replace values (e.g. allows for collapsing captured prepositions into the deprel of the governing token)
  * Connect different tokens in the tree by setting their head feature to one of the match objects
  * Use external configuration files for different scenarios or define rules programmatically when used as a module
  * No language or schema specific details are hardwired into the system - everything is defined in the configuration file
  * Can be used as a very rudimentary rule-based parser to pre-process data with easy dependencies before manual annotation (e.g. attach all articles to following nouns as `det`)

#### TüNDRA

TüNDRA (Tübingen aNnotated Data Retrieval Application) is a web application for searching in treebanks using a lightweight query language inspired by the widely used [TIGERSearch application](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/werkzeuge/tigersearch.html). It offers corpus linguists an interface for using corpora with complex annotation and syntactic links. Most of the treebanks available in TüNDRA are free and publicly available. To access all the treebanks a user has to have an account at a European institution of higher education (i.e. be a student or an employee). Any user may upload a CoNLL-U or a TCF file to browse/search it with the tool. A visualization is interactive (scaling, zooming, panning) and can be saved in multiple formats (e.g. to be later used for a publication). TüNDRA is a part of [CLARIN-D project](http://de.clarin.eu/) and is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF).
