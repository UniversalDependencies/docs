# Coordination in UD v2

* (Gerdes and Kahane (2016))[https://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W16/W16-1715.pdf] criticize our treatment of coordination for two reasons
 1. There is a discrepancy between our treatment of disfluencies (right-headed) and coordination (left-headed) and according to Blanche-Beneviste (1990), there is a continuum between elaboration and disfluency. E.g., _"I saw a room, a bright room, a room with red lights..."
 2. _and bananas_ is a constituent whereas _apples and_ is not

* **Marie's (and their) proposal**: Make the last conjunct the head.
