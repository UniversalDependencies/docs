#### Description

Adverbs typically modify verbs to indicate time, place, location or manner. In Welsh, adverbs of manner, most of which tend to correspond to the English -ly adverbs (effectively, carefully), are constructed through using the predicative particle _yn_ in conjunction with an adjective. 

#### Examples

* _allan_ "out"
* _hefyd_ "also"
* _yn araf_  "slowly"
