### Description

Polarity feature is used for negation expressions. In many Uralic languages
there is a negation verb, for this we use the `Polarity=Neg`. There can also be
a set of verb forms that are used in context of negation verb, for this we use
the Uralic specific [Connegative=Yes]() feature.
