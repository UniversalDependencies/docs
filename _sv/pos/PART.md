Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech (e.g. adpositions, coordinating conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions or auxiliary verbs).

In Swedish `PART` is currently only used for the infinitive marker _att_. Note that not all instances of _att_ are of type `PART`, as _att_ can also be used as a [SCONJ]().

### Example

- _det är möjligt <b>att</b> förändra den_ "it is possible <b>to</b> change it"
