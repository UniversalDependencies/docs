#### Description

The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category.  It should be used very restrictively. We currently use the X POS tag for foreign words, but after the recent work on twitter UD, they might require updating in the next release (v2.7). 

#### Examples 

* _Beidh <b>an-weekend</b> againn_ "We will have a great weekend"
* _san eagrán 'ceart' den pháipéar <b>'on the mainland'</b>_ 'in the right edition of the paper 'on the mainland''
