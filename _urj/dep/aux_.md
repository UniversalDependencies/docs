In Uralic traditional grammars auxiliaries are not often discussed about
comprehensively. It is recommended to use a closed set of verbs as auxiliaries,
for example the main modal verbs as well as the auxiliaries used in periphrastic
tense constructions, and the negation verb if any. The verbs selected should be
documented in the language specific documents.
