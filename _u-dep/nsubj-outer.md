This relation specifies a nominal subject of a copular clause whose predicate is itself a clause, 
to signal that it is not the subject of the nested clause.
See discussion of [Predicate Clauses](../overview/complex-clauses.html#predicate-clauses).

~~~ sdparse

nsubj:outer(tried, problem)

There may be an outer subject with no inner subject:

~~~ sdparse
The important thing is to keep calm.
nsubj:outer(keep, thing)
cop(keep, is)
mark(keep, to)
xcomp(keep, calm)
~~~

The clausal counterpart of this relation is [csubj:outer]().

The `:outer` subtype is *not* intended for most nominal subjects of copular clausesâ€”only those where the predicate is itself a clause. 
Plain [nsubj]() (or another subtype) will be appropriate if the copular clause predicate is a nominal, adjective, etc.:

~~~ sdparse
That book is very good .
nsubj(good, book)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
The title is Green Eggs and Ham .
nsubj(Eggs, title)
