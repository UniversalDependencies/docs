### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned
a real part-of-speech category.

<b>Note:</b> Version 1 of the Swedish UD treebank used X for foreign words (corresponding to the language-specific tag UO), but from version 1.1 these words are given a proper linguistic category and X is currently not used in Swedish. However, it still exists as a potentially permissible tag.
