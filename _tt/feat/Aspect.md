Aspect is a feature that specifies duration of the action in time, whether the action has been completed, ongoing etc.

Tatar does not have a grammatical distinction in verbal finite forms.
However, aspectual difference matterns in some non-finite forms that introduce adverbial clause (converbs).
The following describes the values used for `Aspect` together with the suffixes that typically introduce the defined `Aspect` value.

### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfect aspect

A converb suffix _-гач, -кач, -гәч, -кәч_ implies that the event denoted by the verb is completed.

#### Examples

* _<b>Ашагач</b> монда очрашыйк_ "Let's meet here <b>after eating</b>"

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperfect aspect

The action took / takes / will take some time span and there is no
information whether and when it was / will be completed.
This aspect is marked with a converb suffix _-ганчы, -канчы, -гәнче, -кәнче_.

#### Examples

* _Ашаганчы кулыңны ю_ "Wash your hands <b>before eating</b>"

### <a name="Prog">`Prog`</a>: progressive aspect

Action is in progress with respect to current or a reference time.

Tatar distinguishes this aspect only in a converb construction ("while ...") with a suffix _-а_ or _-ә_.

#### Examples

* _Мин сиңа <b>бара-бара</b> сөйләрмен_ "I will tell you on the road (lit. while going)"
* _Илнар Гөлнараны <b>озата</b> кайтты_ "Ilnar saw Gölnara off"
