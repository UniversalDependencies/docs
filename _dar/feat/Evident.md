Evidentiality is the morphological marking of a speaker’s source of information (Aikhenvald, 2004). In Dargwa, `Evident`iality is a feature of the [verb](dar-pos/VERB). Under the hearsay strategy (Ganenkov 2010), the hearsay marker is placed on the right periphery of finite verbs (and is not followed by any speech verb or quotative particle).  
The first-hand evidence reading for the statement/event is the default and is not marked in Dargwa. In the treebank, the `Fh` (first-hand) value is not tagged.

### <a name="Nfh">`Nfh`: non-first hand  

The speaker has indirect evidence for the statement. The `Nfh` marker is also called `quotative` (QUOT) and `citative` (CIT) in the literature.

#### Examples
```
*  ca   adaj-la     k’wi-jal  urši  le-b-re-k’wan  

   one  father-Gen  two-Card  son   COP-HumPlur-Past-Nfh   

   'A father had (they say) two sons.'   
```
