Case is an inflectional feature of [nouns](uk-pos/NOUN) and other parts of speech ([adjectives](uk-pos/ADJ), [numerals](uk-pos/NUM)) that mark agreement with nouns. It is also valency feature of [prepositions](uk-pos/ADP) (saying that the preposition requires its argument to be in that case).

Case helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence. For example, the nominative and accusative cases often distinguish subject and object of the verb, while in fixed-word-order languages these functions would be distinguished merely by the positions of the nouns in the sentence.

Ukrainian morphology distinguishes seven cases: `Nom`, `Gen`, `Dat`, `Acc`, `Ins`, `Loc`, and `Voc` (this ordering is fixed in the grammar).

#### Examples

* singular nominative _мама&nbsp;_ “mother”, genitive _мами&nbsp;,_ dative _мамі,&nbsp;_ accusative _маму,&nbsp;_ vocative _мамо,&nbsp;_ locative _мамі,&nbsp;_ instrumental _мамою_
* plural nominative _мами,&nbsp;_ genitive _мам,&nbsp;_ dative _мамам,&nbsp;_ accusative _мам,&nbsp;_ vocative _мами,&nbsp;_ locative _мамах,&nbsp;_ instrumental _мамами_

The descriptions of the individual case values below include semantic hints about the prototypical meaning of the case. Bear in mind that quite often a case will be used for a meaning that is totally unrelated to the meaning mentioned here. Valency of verbs, adpositions and other words will determine that the noun phrase must be in a particular grammatical case to fill a particular valency slot (semantic role).

### <a name="Nom">`Nom`</a>: nominative

The base form of the noun, also used as citation form (lemma). This is the word form used for subjects of clauses.

#### Examples

* _<b>Наташа</b> спить._ “<b>Natasha</b> sleeps.”
* _<b>Іван</b> любить Наташу._ “<b>Ivan</b> loves Natasha.”

### <a name="Gen">`Gen`</a>: genitive

Prototypical meaning of genitive is that the noun phrase somehow belongs to its governor; it would often be translated by the English
preposition _of._

Note that despite considerable semantic overlap, the genitive case is not the same as the feature of possessivity ([Poss]()). Possessivity is a lexical feature, i.e. it applies to lemma and its whole paradigm. Genitive is a feature of just a subset of word forms of the lemma. Semantics of possessivity is much more clearly defined while the genitive (as many other cases) may be required in situations that have nothing to do with possessing.

#### Examples

* _Київ -- столиця <b>України</b>.&nbsp;_ “Kyiv is the capital <b>of Ukraine</b>.”

### <a name="Dat">`Dat`</a>: dative

This is the word form often used for indirect objects of verbs.

#### Examples

* _Я подарувала м'яч <b>своєму братові</b>.&nbsp;_ “I gave my brother a ball as a present.” (_своєму братові&nbsp;_ “my brother” is dative and  _м'яч&nbsp;_ “ball” is accusative.)

### <a name="Acc">`Acc`</a>: accusative

Perhaps the second most widely spread morphological case. This is the word form most frequently used for direct objects of verbs.

#### Examples

* _Іван любить <b>Наташу</b>._ “Ivan loves <b>Natasha</b>.”

### <a name="Ins">`Ins`</a>: instrumental

The role from which the name of the instrumental case is derived is that the noun is used as instrument to do something (as in _писати <b>ручкою</b>&nbsp;_ “to write <b>using a pen</b>”). Many other meanings are possible, for example the instrumental is required by the
preposition _з&nbsp;_ “with” and thus it includes the meaning expressed in other languages by the comitative case.

In Ukrainian the instrumental is also used for the agent-object in passive constructions (cf. the English preposition _by_).

#### Examples

* _Цей закон було схвалено <b>владою</b>.&nbsp;_ “This bill has been approved <b>by the government</b>.” (Passive example)

### <a name="Loc">`Loc`</a>: locative

The locative case often expresses location in space or time, which gave it its name. As elsewhere, non-locational meanings also exist and they are not rare. On the other hand, some location roles may be expressed using other cases (e.g. because those cases are required by a preposition).

This is the only Ukrainian case that is used exclusively in combination with prepositions.

#### Examples

* _В <b>липні</b> я був у <b>Швеції</b>.&nbsp;_ “In <b>July</b> I was in <b>Sweden</b>.”
* _Вона при <b>надії</b>.&nbsp;_ “She is expecting a baby.” Literally: “*She is at <b>hope</b>.” (Non-locational non-temporal example)

### <a name="Voc">`Voc`</a>: vocative

The vocative case is a special form of noun used to address someone. Thus it predominantly appears with animate nouns (see the
feature of [Animacy]()). Nevertheless this is not a grammatical restriction and inanimate things can be addressed as well.

#### Examples

* _Що думаєш, <b>Олю</b>?&nbsp;_ “What do you think, <b>Olya</b>?”
* _<b>Зоре моя вечірняя</b>, зійди над горою [...]&nbsp;_ “<b>My evening star</b>, rise over the mountain [...]” (poetic language). Technically only the noun _Зоре_ “star” has a different, vocative form, but the possessive pronoun _моя_ “my” and the adjective _вечірняя_ “evening”, which agree with the noun in gender and number, are treated as vocatives as well.
