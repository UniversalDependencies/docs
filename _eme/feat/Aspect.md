`Aspect` shows the internal temporal structure of a situation.

### <a name="Cont">`Cont`</a>: Continuative

The continuative aspect expresses imperfectivity not occasioned by habit.

The morpheme _`-o`_ appears after a final consonant or vowel, only with a 3rd person subject.

The morpheme _`-ɲ`_ (after a vowel) or _`-iɲ`_ (after a consonant) marks the continuative aspect of action or state predicates whose subject is a 1st or 2nd person.

#### Examples

* _oanõ oiba<b>o</b> kiʔi_&nbsp; “He is waiting for his pet now.” 
* _dadʒaʔodʒi<b>ɲ</b>_&nbsp; “I am not crying.” 
* _ezozopodʒ<b>iɲ</b>_&nbsp; “They feed me.” 


### <a name="Compl">`Compl`</a>: Completive

The completive aspect indicates that the action has been completely performed by all referents of the subject of an intransitive verb or on all possible referents of the object of a transitive verb.


#### Examples

* _oho<b>pa</b>ŋ_&nbsp; “They all left.” 
* _okuwa<b>pa</b> omanõ mãʔẽ_&nbsp; “He knows all the dead.” 

### <a name="Iter">`Iter`</a>: Iterative

The iterative aspect expresses the repetition of an event observable on one single occasion. In Tekó, the iterative aspect is represented by the morpheme `-eʔe` (after a consonant) and `-ʔe` (after a vowel).

#### Examples

* _oho<b>ʔe</b>_&nbsp; “He goes back (He goes and goes again).” 
* _oiɲuŋbanam, opukudʒ opukudʒ<b>eʔe</b>_&nbsp; “When she has finished putting them on, she moved, she moved again.” 


## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
