### Definition

`ADP` is used for adpositions, i.e., prepositions and postpositions (many Uralic
languages won't make strict distinctions). `ADP` can be separated from `ADV` by
lack of complement or if the complement is verb or a clause, it is not unusual
for a word-form to belong to both ADV and ADP categories depending on the
context.  Adpositions are often derived from defective or historic nominal
paradigms, the tagging should follow modern diachronic analysis instead of
etymological.

#### Examples

* [fi] _alla_ "under", _alta_ "from under", _alle_ "to under"
* [fi] _vuoksi_ "because of", _vuokseni_, "because of me"
