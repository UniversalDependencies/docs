### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause. Verbs are often associated with grammatical categories like tense, mood, aspect and voice, which can either be expressed inflectionally or using auxilliary verbs or particles.

Note that the `VERB` tag covers main verbs _(content verbs)_ but it does not cover _auxiliary verbs_ and verbal _copulas_ (in the narrow sense). See [AUX]() for _auxiliary verbs_ and [PART]() for _copulas_.
