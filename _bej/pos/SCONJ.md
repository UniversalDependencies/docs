### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other.
We annotate converbs affixes into subordinating conjunctions, affixes of the verbal stem and element holding the position of relativizer.

### Examples : 

- Relativizer : _bak tʔi -it <b>=eːt</b> ʔiːbaːb / dh =eː ti- ki i- di eːn //_ a story like that happened to me", he said, they said.
- Converb affixe: _hoː =b hoːsoː ʃʔag <b>-aː</b> =b =u uː= tak // ʔasal <b>-aː</b> =b iː- kti =jeːb /_ The man was carrying on his shoulder a lamb that he had grilled.
