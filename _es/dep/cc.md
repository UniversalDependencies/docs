A coordination is the relation between an element of a conjunct and the coordinating conjunction word of the conjunct. (Note: different dependency grammars have different treatments of coordination. We take one conjunct of a conjunction as the head of the conjunction.) A conjunction may also appear at the beginning of a sentence. This is also called a cc, and it depends on the root predicate of the sentence.
