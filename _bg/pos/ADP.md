### Definition

Adposition in Bulgarian is a preposition.
In the BulTreeBank tagset it is encoded as `R`.
Thus, the preposition comes before a complement composed of a noun
phrase, noun, pronoun, or clause that functions as a noun phrase, and
forms a single structure with the complement to express its
grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.

### Examples

- _в_ / _v_ "in"
- _към_ / _kam_ "to"

In Bulgarian, prepositions can take the form of fixed multiword
expressions, such as _in spite of_, _because of_, _thanks to_ in English.
They are treated as multiwords in the treebank, but for the purposes of mapping to this level, they
are treated compositionally.

### Examples

- _по време на_ / _po vreme na_ "during" 

is analyzed as

- _по_ / _po_ "in"
- _време_ / _vreme_ "time"
- _на_ / _na_ "of"
