<p>This section will contain detailed discussion of particular linguistic constructions of interest, covering best practices for how to annotate them cross-linguistically. It is still a work in progress.  At the moment, you can also see:</p>

<h2 id="elements-of-a-clause">Elements of a clause</h2>

<h3 id="secondary-predicates">Secondary predicates</h3>

<p>A clause can contain a <em>secondary predication</em> or <em>predicative</em>. The most common case is with adjectives, although the same effect can sometimes be achieved with a predicative noun or preposition-marked phrase.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>She declared the cake <strong>beautiful</strong>.</em></li>
  <li><em>She declared the cake <strong>a success</strong>.</em></li>
  <li><em>She entered the room <strong>sad</strong>.</em></li>
  <li><em>She hammered the metal <strong>flat</strong>.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There are two predicates in such sentences, the main predicate and an additional one, such as <em>the cake</em> being <em>beatiful</em> or <em>She</em> being <em>sad</em>.</p>

<p>Huddleston and Pullum (2002) “The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language”, chapter 4 section 5.3, divide predicatives into obligatory and optional predicatives, which can be either depictives or resultatives, and which can appear in an intransitive or transitive clause, giving eight possibilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>He looked <strong>fantastic</strong>.</em> [obligatory, depictive, intransitive host]</li>
  <li><em>She kept Kim <strong>warm</strong>.</em> [obligatory, depictive, transitive host]</li>
  <li><em>The boss became <strong>angry</strong>.</em> [obligatory, resultative, intransitive host]</li>
  <li><em>This made me <strong>furious</strong>.</em> [obligatory, resultative, transitive host]</li>
  <li><em>He died <strong>young</strong>.</em> [optional, depictive, intransitive host]</li>
  <li><em>He ate the steak <strong>almost raw</strong>.</em> [optional, depictive, transitive host]</li>
  <li><em>The pond froze <strong>solid</strong>.</em> [optional, resultative, intransitive host]</li>
  <li><em>He painted the house <strong>blue</strong>.</em> [optional, resultative, transitive host]</li>
</ul>

<p>In UD, obligatory predicatives are always treated as an <code>xcomp</code>: The secondary predicate is attached as an <code>xcomp</code> of the main predicate. In most cases, as well as an adjective depictive, you can use a verbal or nominal predicate in the same position (e.g., <em>He looked [an idiot]</em>; <em>This made me [seethe with anger]</em>). </p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">She declared the cake beautiful .
nsubj(declared, She)
dobj(declared, cake)
xcomp(declared, beautiful)
</code></pre>

<p>In the enhanced representation, there is an additional subject link showing the secondary predication, which is obligatorily a particular role in the higher clause:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">She declared the cake beautiful .
nsubj(declared, She)
dobj(declared, cake)
xcomp(declared, beautiful)
nsubj(beautiful, cake)
</code></pre>

<p>A Czech example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">jmenovat někoho generálem \n to-appoint someone as-a-general
dobj(jmenovat, někoho)
xcomp(jmenovat, generálem)
</code></pre>

<p>The relation <code>xcomp</code> is used for core arguments of clausal predicates,
so it will not be used for some other instances of secondary predication.
Optional depictives are analyzed as adjuncts, and made the <a href="">acl</a> of the nominal that they semantically modify (if one is present). </p>

<p>For instance, in <em>She entered the room sad</em> we also have a double predication
(she entered the room; she was sad).
But <em>sad</em> is not a core argument of <em>enter:</em> leaving it out will neither affect grammaticality
nor significantly alter the meaning of the verb.
On the other hand, leaving out <em>beautiful</em> in <em>She declared the cake beautiful</em>
will either render the sentence ungrammatical or lead to a different interpretation of <em>declared.</em></p>

<p>The result is that in <em>She entered the room sad,</em> <em>sad</em> will depend on <em>She</em>
and the relation will be <a href="">acl</a> instead of <code>xcomp</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">She entered the room sad .
dobj(entered, room)
acl(She, sad)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">He painted the model naked .
dobj(painted, model)
acl(model, naked)
</code></pre>

<p>If the nominal head is missing, the secondary predicate must be attached as
<a href="">advcl</a> of the verbal predicate, even though it is an <a href="../pos/ADJ.html">adjective</a>,
not an <a href="../pos/ADV.html">adverb</a>. There is a second predication and the adjective heads the predication (just like in <em>She is sad</em>) and in this case there are simply no other words expressing this second predication:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Vstoupila do místnosti smutná . \n She-entered to room sad .
advcl(Vstoupila, smutná)
advcl(She-entered, sad)
</code></pre>

<p>The remaining, most subtle case is optional resultatives. For these, 
we uniformly use <code>xcomp</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">He painted the house blue .
dobj(painted, house)
xcomp(painted, blue)
</code></pre>

<p>Even though the resultative is optional here, one may argue that it is still a complement (an argument) of the higher verb
(he is painting something blue), in a way that is not true of depictives. Such an analysis of optional depictives as core arguments is adopted for English by Huddleston and Pullum (p. 262). In LFG terms, we would say that the verb has acquired a new
subcategorization frame by application of a lexical rule, and that this frame
includes an additional <code>xcomp</code> argument. Such an analysis is buttressed by the fact that normally intransitive verbs like <em>to bark</em> can also form similar resultatives by gaining a new subcategorization which adds both a <code>dobj</code> and an <code>xcomp</code>, as in the example below.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">The dog barked the neighbors awake .
dobj(barked, neighbors)
xcomp(barked, awake)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="elements-of-a-nominal">Elements of a nominal</h2>

<h2 id="adjectival-and-adverbial-constructions">Adjectival and adverbial constructions</h2>

<h3 id="comparatives">Comparatives</h3>

<p>The syntax of comparative constructions poses various challenges for linguistic theory.  For English, many of these are discussed in Bresnan (1973) and Huddleston and Pullum (2002, chapter 13). We give a discussion of equality comparisons (<em>That car is as big as mine</em>) and inequality scalar comparisons (<em>Sue is taller than Jim</em>).</p>

<p>In constructions of the form <em>as X as Y</em> or <em>the same X as Y</em>, X and
Y can be of a range of syntactic types, leading to surface forms such as those exemplified below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Commitment is as important as a player’s talent.</em></li>
  <li><em>Get the cash to him as soon as possible.</em></li>
  <li><em>I put in as much flour as the recipe called for.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>We note that the head of the whole construction appears to be the head of the X phrase. We can simply say:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Commitment is important.</em> </li>
  <li><em>Get the cash to him soon.</em></li>
  <li><em>I put in flour.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>We then say that the first <em>as</em> is an independent modifier in the comparative, modifying something in the X phrase, in part because the following <em>as Y</em> is fairly optional:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Commitment is (just) as important.</em></li>
  <li><em>?Get the cash to him (just) as soon.</em></li>
  <li><em>I put in (just) as much flour.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>However, this first <em>as</em> may not modify the head of X, it may modify an existing modifier of the head of X. Its role is adverbial (<a href="">u-dep/advmod</a>) consistent with other kinds of degree modification:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Commitment is as important as a player ’s talent .
advmod(important, as-3)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">I put in as much flour as the recipe called for .
advmod(much, as-4)
amod(flour, much)
</code></pre>

<p>We then take the complement of the comparative as an oblique dependent of the first part. It is clear that the material in the complement <em>as Y</em> can be clausal. It is also usually optional, as indicated above. For that reason, we usually make the complement an <a href="">u-dep/advcl</a>, with the second <em>as</em> analyzed as a mark.  That gives us:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">I do n't hear from my brother as often as I previously heard from him .
nsubj(hear, I-1)
aux(hear, do)
neg(hear, n't)
case(brother, from-5)
det(brother, my)
nmod(hear, brother)
advmod(often, as-8)
advmod(hear, often)
mark(heard, as-10)
nsubj(heard, I-11)
advmod(heard, previously)
advcl(often, heard)
case(him, from-14)
nmod(heard, him)
punct(hear, .)
</code></pre>

<p>We take the <em>as Y</em> clause as a dependent of the content-word whose degree is being assessed (here <em>often</em>). We take its head to be the head of the clause, here <em>heard</em>.  An initially plausible alternative analysis would be to make the clausal dependent headed by <em>as</em> a dependent of the comparative modifier <em>as</em>, <em>more</em>, or <em>less</em>, and indeed this is the analysis which Huddleston and Pullum (2002) argue for in English. However, there are several reasons to doubt this analysis.  One is the general principles of UD in favoring content words as heads. A second argument is motivated by a desire for crosslinguistic adequacy: in languages such as Finnish and Japanese, this functional element is not present.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">“Y” より “X” が 面白い 。 \n Y than X NOM interesting .
nsubj(面白い, “X”)
case(“X”, が)
case(“Y”, より)
nmod(面白い, “Y”)
punct(面白い, 。)
</code></pre>

<p>Since the first <em>as</em> is a functional element, the dependent can be understood to modify the whole phrase <em>as often</em>, and therefore is attached to the head of that phrase. Additionally, it might be noted that comparatives without a comparative word occur in certain varieties of English. For example in Indian English you find usages such as <em>So don’t worry if you think that you have a girl-friend, who is intelligent than you.</em> One further argument from morphological comparatives is discussed below.</p>

<p>The same basic analysis is given for inequality scalar comparatives, with <em>more</em> or <em>less</em> or a comparative adjective and <em>than</em>, parallel to the two uses of <em>as</em> above, except that <em>more</em> can also directly modify a noun, and is then taken to have the <a href="">u-dep/amod</a> relation to the noun.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">more sausages than you bought last week
amod(sausages, more)
advcl(sausages, bought)
mark(bought, than)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">more important than you thought
advmod(important, more)
advcl(important, thought)
mark(thought, than)
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to crosslinguistic adequacy, we can see here another possible advantage of not attaching the <em>than</em> clause to <em>more</em>: This analysis then means that the dependency structure is more parallel between cases with a periphrastic comparative like <em>more intelligent</em> and a morphological comparative like <em>taller</em> (even though in bound morpheme cases, the <em>-er</em> could be argued to be the comparative head).</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">smarter than you thought
advcl(smarter, thought)
mark(thought, than)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">fiksumpi kuin luulit \n smarter than you_thought
advcl(fiksumpi, luulit)
mark(luulit, kuin)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">a smarter boy than you thought
amod(boy, smarter)
advcl(smarter, thought)
mark(thought, than)
</code></pre>

<p>If the head is ellided, then the functional element can be promoted.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Wheat raises blood sugar even more than sugar does .
advcl(more, does)
</code></pre>

<p>Very commonly the complement clause in a comparative undergoes various amounts of partial reduction or ellipsis, sometimes to a quite extreme extent:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">I put in as much flour as the recipe called for .
nsubj(put, I)
compound(put, in)
advmod(much, as-4)
amod(flour, much)
dobj(put, flour)
mark(called, as-7)
det(recipe, the)
nsubj(called, recipe)
advcl(much, called)
nmod(called, for)
punct(put, .)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">He plays better drunk than sober
nsubj(plays, He)
advmod(plays, better)
acl(He, drunk)
mark(sober, than)
advcl(better, sober)
</code></pre>

<p>In general, we treat whatever remnant that remains as still an <a href="">u-dep/advcl</a>, as above. </p>

<p>However, a limiting case of this is that only a nominal is present:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>as important as a player ‘s talent</em></li>
  <li><em>more important than a player ‘s talent</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The analysis in this case is unclear: Should the comparative complement still be analyzed as an extremely reduced complement clause or analyzed as simply a nominal modifier? There are arguments for both positions. For English, there is a long discussion of the arguments in section 2.2 of chapter 13 of Huddleston and Pullum (2002). We err on the side of minimizing the postulation of unobserved structure and opt to treat these cases as just an oblique nominal complement:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">as important as a player 's talent
advmod(important, as-1)
case(talent, as-3)
nmod(important, talent)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">more important than a player 's talent
advmod(important, more)
case(talent, than)
nmod(important, talent)
</code></pre>
