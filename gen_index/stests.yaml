  name: Passive subject of a NOUN
  required_empty: true
  expr: "_ <nsubjpass NOUN"
  desc: Nouns may have subjects in copula-like constructions. Copula-like constructions may be passive if the predicate is passive participle. But a combination of the two cases seems too much.

  required_empty: true

-
  name: PRON or DET lacks the PronType feature

-
  name: Degree feature used with a word that is neither adjective nor adverb
  required_empty: true
  expr: "Degree&!ADJ&!ADV"
  desc: The Degree feature is normally associated with (a subset of) adjectives and adverbs. Other tags than ADJ and ADV are probably wrong.

  expr: "_ >nsubj|>csubj|>nsubjpass|>csubjpass _ >nsubj|>csubj|>nsubjpass|>csubjpass _"
  desc: <b>DEBUGGING TEST. NONZERO HITS DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA IS INVALID.</b> No predicate can have more than one subject. Note that subordinate clauses do not head copulas for this reason.

-
  name: Maximum one direct object
  expr: "_ >dobj|>ccomp _ >dobj|>ccomp _"
  desc: <b>DEBUGGING TEST. NONZERO HITS DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA IS INVALID.</b> No predicate can have more than one direct object. Ccomp counts as direct object. (To certain extent xcomp does too, but dobj can co-occur with xcomp in cases of secondary predication, thus this test does not look at xcomp.)

-
  name: Case not dependent on nmod
  expr: "_ <case (_ (<!nmod&<!nmod:agent&<!conj) _)"
  desc: <b>DEBUGGING TEST. NONZERO HITS DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA IS INVALID.</b> If a word is marked as having a case dependency, its head should usually be marked as being a nominal modifier. But note that several legitimate exceptions occur, in particular, through coordination (where the head is labeled conj instead of nmod) and in nominal clauses (where the head is the main predicate of a clause). Also, in some languages case can modify also objects and other nominals.

-
  name: NOUN and case
  expr: NOUN <case _
  expr-pos: _ <case _
  desc: <b>DEBUGGING TEST. NONZERO HITS DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA IS INVALID.</b> A word marked as a NOUN should not be a case dependency.

-
  name: ADP is not leaf
  expr: "ADP >!conj&>!cc&>!punct&>!mwe&>!foreign _"
  desc: <b>DEBUGGING TEST. NONZERO HITS DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA IS INVALID.</b> By default adposition is a leaf node attached to a nominal as case. Exceptions where adpositions are not leaves involve technical relations such as mwe and conj.

  name: Appos chain
  required_empty: true
  expr: "_ <appos (_ <appos _)"

  neg_ex: "Sam , my brother , John 's cousin , arrived\nappos(Sam, brother)\nappos(brother, cousin)"
  desc: <b>DEBUGGING TEST. NONZERO HITS DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA IS INVALID.</b> Apposition dependencies should not be chained. Multiple appositions should all be attached to the head, or they should be coordinated (with the first apposition as the head). Legitimate exceptions do occur, however, in the rare case when an apposition has an apposition of its own, which does not apply to head of the first apposition.

-
  name: Relation advmod used for node that is not ADV
  expr: "(!ADV) <advmod _"
  desc: <b>DEBUGGING TEST. NONZERO HITS DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA IS INVALID.</b> Advmod is intended only for adverbs. Modifiers that are called adverbial in some traditional grammars, but are in fact prepositional or noun phrases, should be attached as nmod.
  link: http://universaldependencies.org/docs/u/dep/advmod.html

-
  name: Heads of an advmod are nominal
  expr: "_ <advmod (NOUN|PROPN|NUM|PRON)"
  desc: "<b>DEBUGGING TEST. NONZERO HITS DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA IS INVALID.</b> The heads of an adverbial modifier should normally not be nominal (noun, proper noun, numeral, or pronoun). Exceptions occur in nominal clauses, where a nominal is the main predicate and can therefore take clause adverbials. Example: This is probably an exception."

#Note: in the following test expr is between double quotes because ! has a special meaning in yaml
#      also, because expr is not simple (starting with _), expr-pos is given as a basis of the links
#      that are placed in the table. The first _ is always varied with POS
-
  name: Acl not dependent on NOUN/PROPN/PRON
  expr: "!PRON&!NOUN&!PROPN >acl _"
  expr-pos: _ >acl _
  desc: <b>DEBUGGING TEST. NONZERO HITS DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA IS INVALID.</b> Clausal modifiers of nouns should depend on NOUN/PROPN only; those in the following table depend on other parts of speech.

-
  name: Marked as NUM but not nummod, nmod or compound
  expr: "NUM (<!nummod&<!nmod&<!compound) _"
  expr-pos: "_ (<!nummod&<!nmod&<!compound) _"
  desc: "<b>DEBUGGING TEST. NONZERO HITS DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA IS INVALID.</b> If a word is marked as a numeral (POS), then it should be marked as being a nummod, compound or nmod dependency. Exceptions occur when the numeral is promoted to a higher function through ellipis. Example: Take five!"

-
  name: Marked as nummod but not NUM
  expr: "!NUM <nummod _"
  expr-pos: _ <nummod _

  name: Marked as AUX but not aux or auxpass
  expr: "AUX (<!aux&<!auxpass) _"
  expr-pos: "_ (<!aux&<!auxpass) _"
  desc: <b>DEBUGGING TEST. NONZERO HITS DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA IS INVALID.</b> If a word is marked as the auxiliary POS, it should be marked as either aux or auxpass dependency.
  link: http://universaldependencies.org/docs/u/pos/AUX_.html

-
  name: Marked as aux or auxpass but not AUX
  expr: "!AUX (<aux|<auxpass) _"
  expr-pos: _ (<aux|<auxpass) _
  desc: <b>DEBUGGING TEST. NONZERO HITS DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA IS INVALID.</b> If a word is marked as a (passive) auxiliary dependency, it should be marked as the auxiliary POS.
  link: http://universaldependencies.org/docs/u/dep/aux_.html

-
  name: Marked as cc but not CONJ, SYM or ADV
  expr: "!CONJ&!SYM&!ADV <cc _"
  desc: <b>DEBUGGING TEST. NONZERO HITS DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA IS INVALID.</b> The relation cc is for coordinating conjunctions, hence the most expected POS tag is CONJ. Symbols such as + may occasionally replace conjunctions, and in some languages some adverbs may take this syntactic function too. However, most other tags are suspicious at least.
  link: http://universaldependencies.org/docs/u/dep/cc.html

-
  name: Cc is not leaf
  expr: _ < (_ <cc _)
  desc: <b>DEBUGGING TEST. NONZERO HITS DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA IS INVALID.</b> Coordinating conjunction should be attached to the first conjunct and it should not have its own dependents.
  link: http://universaldependencies.org/docs/u/dep/cc.html

-
  name: Marked as neg but not PART or ADV
  expr: "!PART&!ADV <neg _"
  desc: <b>DEBUGGING TEST. NONZERO HITS DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA IS INVALID.</b> The neg relation is used to attach negating particles (sometimes also tagged as adverbs; but we probably want to choose just one tag), such as English <i>not</i>, to the predicate or phrase they negate. It is not used for negative determiners such as English <i>no</i> in <i>there is no chance</i>, which should be attached as det.
