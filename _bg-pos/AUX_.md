### Definition

An auxiliary verb is a verb that accompanies the lexical verb of a
verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the
lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, and voice.

In Bulgarian the auxiliary verbs are the following:

- Vx# / _съм_ / _sam_ "to be" 
- Vy# /_бъда_ / _bada_ "to be" 
- Vi# / _бивам_ / _bivam_ "to be" 

_Modal verbs_ count as [main verbs](VERB) in BulTreeBank tagset and they are thus tagged `VERB`.


### Examples

- Tense and passive auxiliaries: _<b>бях</b>_ / _byah_ "I was"
