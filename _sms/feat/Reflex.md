Reflexive possessives indicate that the topic/subject of the clause is the possessor:


### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is possessive

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not reflexive, the
`Reflex` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT`
column. (Which means that empty value has the `No` meaning.)

#### Examples

* [sms] _... di <b>jiõčč</b> tietenki tok kuättses mâânn. &nbsp;_ “... and of course <b>he himself</b> went there into the tent.”
