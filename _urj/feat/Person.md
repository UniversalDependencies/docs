Person is typically a feature of personal and possessive pronouns / determiners,
and of verbs. On verbs it is in fact an agreement feature that marks the person

possessives, for further informations, see [Person[psor]]() and
[Person[psed]]().

The fourth person of some Uralic grammars is [Person=Impers]().
