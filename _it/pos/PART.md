The use of `PART` is limited to possessive markers, in English names: [en] ‘s.

According to the UD guidelines, particles may also encode grammatical
categories such as negation, e.g. 

- Negation particle: [en] _not;_ [de] _nicht;_ [tr] _mu_

In Italian however we tag negation particles, such as _non_, as a negation 
adverb. See [ADV]().
