# Coptic Auxiliaries

The standard Coptic grammar posits many auxiliaries. The basic form of most Coptic predications is: [AUX]() + `subj` + [VERB](). Where `AUX` determines tense, aspect, modality and polarity, and the verb is just an uninflected infinitive. The auxiliary forms are listed in the documentation for the XPOS tagset [here](https://github.com/CopticScriptorium/tagger-part-of-speech/blob/master/scriptorium_tagset_documentation.pdf).

See also the documentation of the [aux]() relation.

* _ϣⲁ_ – aorist, form for pronominal subject
* _ⲙⲉⲣⲉ_ – negative aorist (it is generally not the case), form for noun subject
* _ⲙⲉ_ – negative aorist, form for pronoun subject
* _ⲁ_ – positive past tense
* _ⲙⲡⲉ_ – negative past (for noun subject)
* _ⲙⲡ_ – negative past  (for pronoun subject)
* _ⲛⲉⲣⲉ_ – imperfect (for noun subject)
* _ⲛⲉ_ – imperfect (for pronoun subject)
* _ⲛⲁ_ – future tense
* _ⲛⲧⲉ_ – ‘conjunctive’ (marks that a verb has identical tense aspect to its
subordinating verb, whatever that is)
* _ⲧⲁⲣⲉ_ – future conjunctive (let it be the case in the future …) (for noun
subject)
* _ⲧⲁⲣ_ – future conjunctive (let it be the case in the future …) (for
pronoun subject)
* _ϣⲁⲛⲧⲉ_ – limitative (indicates actions occurring until another action occurs)
* _ⲙⲡⲁⲧⲉ_ – negative limitative (something has not yet occurred while something
else happens)
* _ⲛⲧⲉⲣⲉ_ – ‘precursive’ (one action happens after another)
* _ⲉⲣϣⲁⲛ_ – conditional mood
* _ⲉϣ, ϣ_ – potential mood (can…)
* _ⲛⲉϣ_ – rare negated form of _ⲉϣ_ “not be able to” – we’d like to not split the
negation, since this negation is archaic (does not appear by itself for this
form) and the negative form will appear separately in dictionaries as its own
word:

* _ⲉⲣⲉ_ – standard prenominal positive optative
* _ⲛⲛⲉ_ – negative optative
* _ⲙⲁⲣⲉ_ – jussive (let it be the case now…)
* _ⲙⲡⲣⲧⲣⲉ_ – negative jussive (may it not be the case…)
