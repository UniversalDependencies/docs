In Irish, definiteness is indicated through the use of a definite article singular _<b>an</b>_ or plural _<b>na</b>_ (also used with feminine singular in genitive case, see below), much like the definite article "the" in English. There is no indefinite particle, with nouns considered indefinite unless otherwise indicated.

### `Def` : definite

Determiners _<b>an</b>_ and _<b>na</b>_ are both definite, as mentioned above.

In the case of a genitive construction (eg _hata fhir an bhaile_ "the hat of the man of the town"), the noun can also indicate definiteness, though treatment depends on gender and number. 

#### Nominative case

In the nominative case (see [Case]()) nouns undergo some changes following the definite article _<b>an</b>_; most feminine nouns are lenited after the definite article, while feminine nouns beginning with 's' are eclipsed, becoming '<b>t</b>s'. Meanwhile, masculine nouns beginning with a vowel get the prefix 't-'.

#### Examples

* _<b>an</b> bua_ "the win"
* _<b>an</b> f<b>h</b>arraige_ "the sea"
* _<b>an t</b>seachtain_ "the week"
* _<b>an t-</b>aonad_ "the unit"

Following the plural definite article _<b>na</b>_, both masculine and feminine nouns beginning with a vowel receive the prefix 'h'.

#### Examples

* _<b>na</b> buntáistí_ "the advantages"
* _<b>na h</b>ábhair_ "the subjects"

#### Genitive

In the genitive case (see [Case]()) the singular definite article _<b>an</b>_ is only used with masculine nouns. In this case, masculine nouns behave like feminine nouns in the nominative case, most masculine nouns beginning with a consonant are lenited, and those beginning with a 's' change to 'ts'. However, nouns beginning with a vowel remain the same.

#### Examples

* _imeachtaí <b>an</b> Éirí Amach_ "activities of the uprising"
* _chumas <b>an</b> p<b>h</b>áiste_ "ability of the child"
* _biaiste <b>an t</b>samhraidh_ "season of summer"

The plural definite article _<b>na</b>_ is used with feminine singular nouns. In this case, feminine singular nouns beginning with a vowel are prefixed by 'h', while those beginning with a consonant don't change. For plural nouns, _<b>na</b>_ triggers eclipsis where nouns begin with a consonant. Plural nouns beginning with a vowel are eclipsed by the prefix 'n-'.

#### Examples

* _thitim <b>na h</b>oíche_ "fall of the night"
* _óga <b>na</b> tíre_ "young of the country"
* _eagras <b>na bh</b>fostóirí_ "organisation of the employers"
* _measc <b>na n-</b>ábhar_ "middle of the subjects"

### `Ind` : indefinite

There are no indefinite articles in Irish, however some nouns may inflect to show indefinite features.

#### Examples

* _a gcuid uibheacha_ "her eggs"
* _as láimh_ "out of hand"
