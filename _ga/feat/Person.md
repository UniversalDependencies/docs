Person is a feature of personal and possessive pronouns and verbs. In verbs, this feature marks the subject, in some cases allowing the subject to be dropped entirely. In Irish, some verbs are constructed synthetically, and some are analytically constructed. Verb stems in Irish are either broad or slender (see [NounType]()), and are inflected differently depending on this.

### `1` : first person

The first person refers to the speaker; singular first person includes just one speaker, while plural first person includes many speakers, or groups the speaker with others. In Irish verbs, the first person forms a synthetic verb, where the subject pronoun may be dropped from the verb. Prepositional and possessive pronouns also inflect to denote person and number.

#### Examples

* _Dún<b>aim</b>_ "I close"
* _Tuig<b>im</b>_ "I understand"
* _Dún<b>aimid</b>_ "We close"
* _Tuig<b>imid</b>_ "We understand"

### `2` : second person

The second person refers to the listener. The singular first person denotes just one listener, while the plural form denotes several listeners. Verbs in Irish do not indicate 2nd person, so subject pronouns are necessary (i.e. analytic form).

#### Examples

* _Dúnann <b>tú/sibh</b>_ "You(sing/pl) close
* _Tuigeann <b>tú/sibh</b>_ "You(sing/pl) understand


### `3` : third person

The third person refers to one or more persons who are not present, i.e. neither speakers nor listeners. Verbs in the third person are analytical, like with second person.

#### Examples

* _Dúnann <b>sé/sí/siad</b>_ "He/she/they close(s)
* _Tuigeann <b>sé/sí/siad</b>_ "He/she/they understand(s)
