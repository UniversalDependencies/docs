The Yupik verb inflects for the number (and person) of subject. If subject is provided as a separate noun, it agrees with the verb ending in number (and person).

### <a name="Sing">`Sing`</a>: singular subject

#### Examples

* [ess] _Pagunghaat <b>aavgii</b>._ "<b>She/he divided</b> the crowberries in two." The verb ending _-i_ `Number[subj]=Sing|Person[subj]=3` in _aavgii_ encodes that the subject is third person singular (he/she/it).

### <a name="Dual">`Dual`</a>: dual subject

#### Examples

* [ess] _Qakun <b>igleghlleqestung?</b>._ "When <b>will we take off?</b>." The verb ending _-ung_ `Number[subj]=Dual|Person[subj]=1` in _igleghlleqestung_ encodes that the subject is first person dual (we, dual).


### <a name="Plur">`Plur`</a>: plural subject

#### Examples

* [ess] _<b>Kinkungaawat</b> aqelqat?_ "<b>Who are</b> the guests?" The verb ending _-t_ `Number[subj]=Plur|Person[subj]=3` in _kinkungaawat_ "who are they?" agrees with the object _aqelqat_ "guests" `Number=Plur` in person.
