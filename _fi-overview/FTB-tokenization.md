FinnTreeBank UD tokenization
============================

FinnTreeBank 1 has two tokens for those surface forms
where a function word is fused with the negative verb.
For example, "ellei" 'if not' is analyzed as "ell ei" where
"ell" is considered the same as, and lemmatized as, "jos" 'if'.

FinnTeeBank 1 contains a small number of proper names as
"multiword" tokens.
