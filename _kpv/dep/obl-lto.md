The _obl:lto_ relation is used for oblique spacial modifiers with locative goal, i.e. direction to modality,
see also _advmod:lto_.
This is distinguished from other locative dependency relations obl:lmod, obl:lfrom and obl:lmp,
and _advmod_ locative dependency relations advmod:lmod, advmod:lfrom and advmod:lmp,
which generally indicate locative, source and path, respectively.
