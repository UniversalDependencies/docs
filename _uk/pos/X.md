### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category.

A special usage of `X` is for cases of code-switching where it is not possible (or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language
grammatically (and where the dependency relation _foreign_ is typically used in the syntactic analysis).

Even if foreign words are tagged `X`, this usage does not extend to ordinary loan words which should be assigned a normal
part-of-speech. For example, _кілт&nbsp;_ “kilt” is an ordinary [NOUN]().

### Examples

- _А він тільки <b>xfgh pdl jklw</b>&nbsp;_ “And he just <b>xfgh pdl jklw</b>”
