A nominal subject (`nsubj`) is a nominal which is the syntactic subject and the proto-agent of a clause.
That is, it is in the position that passes typical grammatical test for subjecthood, and this argument is the more agentive,
the do-er, or the proto-agent of the clause. This nominal may be headed by a noun, 
or it may be a pronoun or relative pronoun or, in ellipsis contexts, other things such as an adjective.

**New from v2:** The `nsubj` relation is also used for the nominal subject of a passive verb or verb group, even
though the subject is then not typically the proto-agent argument due to valency changing operations. For languages
that have a grammaticalized passive transformation, it is strongly recommended to use the subtype [nsubj:pass]() in 
such cases. If the subject is of a copular clause whose predicate is itself a clause, [nsubj:outer]() may be used.

The governor of the `nsubj` relation might not always be a verb: when
the verb is a copular verb, the root of the clause is the complement
of the copular verb, which can be an adjective or noun, including a noun marked by a preposition,
as in the examples below.

The `nsubj` role is only applied to semantic arguments of a predicate.
When there is an empty argument in a grammatical subject position (sometimes called a pleonastic or expletive),
it is labeled as [expl](). If there is then a displaced subject
in the clause, as in the English existential _there_ construction, it will be labeled as `nsubj`.)
