`Foreign` is a lexical feature of some words belonging to class [X: other](X). It is assigned to intervening foreign words that have not been analyzed grammatically. These can appear as a string or in combination with other Slovenian words. If a word is commonly used in Slovenian and displays Slovenian grammatical behavior, such as inflection, it is considered to be a Slovenian (loan) word, not a foreign word.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is foreign

#### Examples

* _<b>de</b>_ in _Rio <b>de</b> Janeiro_
* _<b>of</b>_ in _Life <b>of</b> Brian_
* _<b>the</b>_ in _Billy <b>the</b> Kid_

### Conversion from JOS

All tokens with tag Residual and Type=foreign are converted to `X` and Foreign=Yes.
