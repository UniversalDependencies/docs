Boolean feature of verbs ([VERB]() and [AUX]()), marking a word as
being in connegative form.

In Skolt Sami, negations are formed combining with the auxiliary negative verb (*ij*).

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: word is connegative

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not connegative, the
`Connegative` feature will not appear.

#### Examples

* [sms] _Jiõm <b>pâsttam</b> ..._ "I didn't <b>manage</b> to ..."
