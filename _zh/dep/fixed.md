The relation `fixed` is used for function words and short adverbials that are composed of separate parts for which internal structure is either difficult to determine or does not make sense to annotate. The first element of the expression is the head which governs all the following elements. 

Because written Chinese does not indicate word boundaries, function words and short adverbials that may have historically consisted of separate words are likely to be treated as a single token at the word segmentation stage. For this reason, this relation is unlikely to be used in Chinese text. However, we leave it as an optional label that may be used in exceptional cases where [goeswith]() may be an unsatisfactory treatment.
