# Introduction

There are two  UD treebanks of Modern Greek (EL): UD_Greek-GDT, UD_Greek-GUD. 
  * GDT and GUD have adopted the same tokenization and word segmentation guidelines. 
  * The two treebanks present notable differences as regards morphological annotation; these differences are presented in [index]().

The  UD documentation for EL morphology [el_pos](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/tree/pages-source/_el/pos) and [el_feat](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/tree/pages-source/_el/feat) is based on research in the context of the GUD. 

The  UD documentation for EL syntax  [syntactic structures](../overview/syntax.html) is based on research in the context of the [Greek Dependency Treebank](http://gdt.ilsp.gr/) (GDT). On the other hand, in GUD, the syntactic guidelines of GDT are taken as a baseline but they are being edited with an ongoing project whose results will be reported in due time. 

GDT is a resource for Modern Greek manually annotated for morphology, syntax and semantics. It is an ongoing project led by researchers at the [Institute for Language and Speech Processing](http://www.ilsp.gr/) (ILSP/Athena Research Centre), with the help of students from the Technoglossia postgraduate program and the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. The texts include transcripts of European parliamentary sessions, articles from the Greek Wikipedia, and web documents pertaining the politics, health, and travel domains. The annotation scheme used for the original syntactic layer of the GDT is based on an adaptation of the guidelines for the Prague Dependency Treebank.

GUD is a resource for EL manually annotated for morphology and syntax. It is an ongoing project led by Stella Markantonatou and Vivian Stamou (hereinafter: the GUD team), both researchers at the [Institute for Language and Speech Processing](http://www.ilsp.gr/) (ILSP/Athena Research Centre), with the contribution of students of [Language Technology](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en/studies/graduate/lg), an MSc program co-organised by the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA) and ILSP. The texts include randomly selected extracts of Modern Greek fiction.  The annotation scheme used for the morphological annotation of GUD is based on UD.v2.

## Acknowledgments

The GDT team wish to thank ILSP researchers Haris Papageorgiou and Maria Koutsombogera, as well as all student annotators for their contributions to the GDT effort.

The GUD team ows special thanks to Socratis Vakirtzian (NKUA). Thanks are also expressed to the NKUA students Fei Poulou, Georgia Apostolopoulou, Antonis Balas and Maria Panagiotopoulou, as well as the 2020-2022 students of [Language Technology](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en/studies/graduate/lg) for their contribution to the morphological annotation of the treebank.
