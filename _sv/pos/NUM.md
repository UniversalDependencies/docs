### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the
number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Cardinal numerals are covered by NUM regardless of syntactic function and regardless of whether they are expressed as words (_fyra_ "four"), digits (4) or Roman numerals (IV). By contrast, ordinal numerals are always tagged ADJ.

Note that in Swedish the decimal mark is most often a comma. Thousands are then separated by either a space or dot.
