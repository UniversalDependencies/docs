There are two constructions that use a copula and a relative clause modifier, _'S ann_ and _'S e_.
`csubj:outer` is relevant to _'S ann_.

* _'S ann_ or _Sann_ fronts adjectives, adverbs, APs, PPs and adverbial clauses.
This is then linked to the relative clause modifier by `csubj:cleft` _except_ in the case where it is itself a clause with a subject.
In that case we use `csubj:outer` instead.

### Examples

* _Cha b' ann gus an do chaochail Lachlann Thorrloisg a b' urrainn do neach a ràdh gun..._ "It was not until Lachlann Thorrloisg died that someone could say that..." (fp03\_019, slightly edited)
