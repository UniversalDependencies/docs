An adverbial clause modifier is a clause which modifies a verb or other predicate (adjective, etc.), as a modifier not as a core complement. This includes things such as a temporal clause, consequence, conditional clause, purpose
clause, etc. The dependent must be clausal (or else it is an [advmod]()) and the dependent is the main predicate of the clause.

## Optional Depictives

This relation is also used for optional depictive adjectives, where the adjective is introduced in clause structure independently of the nominal it describes (contrast: [acl]() if the adjective is an adnominal predicate). The depictive adjective is treated as an adverbial clause modifier of the higher clause. The adjective also provides a secondary predication, where the nominal predicand may or may not be overt; if it is overt, the secondary predication can be represented with an enhanced dependency. See [xcomp]() for further discussion of resultatives and depictives.

~~~ sdparse
She entered the room sad
advcl(entered, sad)
~~~

*Sad* describes the person entering the room, not the manner of enteringâ€”but is still taken to modify the verb.
Note the similarity to the *while sad* example above. Omitting the nominal predicand *she* does not change the basic analysis:

~~~ sdparse
Entering the room sad is not recommended
advcl(Entering, sad)
~~~
