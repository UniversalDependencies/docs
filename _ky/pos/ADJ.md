### Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes.
They may also function as predicates, as in

- _<b>жаңы</b> жол_ "(the) new road"  
- _жол <b>жаңы</b>_  "(the) road is new"

In Kyrgyz the Adjective do not inflect.

We distinguish between adjectives, [determiners](DET) and [numerals](NUM).
We do _not_ mark determiners as adjectives as is the case in most (traditional)
dictionaries and grammars.

### Examples

- _büyük_ "big"
- _eski_ "old"
- _yeşil_ "green"
