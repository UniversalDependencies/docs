### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [verbs](VERB) for such
categories as time, place, direction or manner. They may also modify
[adjectives](ADJ) and other adverbs, as in _<b>velmi významně</b>&nbsp;_ “very significantly” or
_<b>prokazatelně</b> chybný&nbsp;_ “provably wrong”.

There is a closed subclass of _pronominal adverbs_ that refer to
circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly; similarly
to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, relative,
demonstrative etc. Pronominal adverbs also get the `ADV`
part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional features.

In accord with the UD approach,
adverbial ordinal numerals _(poprvé, posedmé, postopadesáté)&nbsp;_
are tagged `ADV`, although the traditional grammar classifies
them as numerals.
The same holds for multiplicative numerals
_(jednou, sedmkrát, stopadesátkrát).&nbsp;_

Note that Czech transgressives (also called adverbial participles or converbs)
are tagged [VERB](), not `ADV`.

### Examples

- _velmi&nbsp;_ “very”

- multiplicative numeral adverbs: _jednou, dvakrát, třikrát&nbsp;_ “once, twice, three times”
- interrogative adverbs: _kde, kam, kdy, jak, proč&nbsp;_ “where, where to, when, how, why”

- indefinite adverbs: _někde, někam, někdy, nějak&nbsp;_ “somewhere, to somewhere, sometime, somehow”
- total adverbs: _všude, vždy&nbsp;_ “everywhere, always”
- negative adverbs: _nikde, nikdy&nbsp;_ “nowhere, never”
