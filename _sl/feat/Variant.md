In Slovenian, the `Variant` feature is either a lexical or inflectional features of some [pronouns](PRON).

### `Bound`: bound form

This value is assigned as a lexical feature of fused combinations of prepositions and personal pronouns that are currently tokenized as one word form and annotated as [personal](PronType) pronouns.

#### Examples

* _To je <b>zame</b> preveč._ "This is too much _for me_"
* _<b>Skozenj</b> je stekel električni tok._ "Electric current ran _through him_."
* _<b>Prednjo</b> so postavili kozarec vina._ "A glass of wine was put _in front of her._"

### `Short`: clitic form

This value is assigned as an inflectional feature to clitic personal pronouns in genitive, dative and accusative to distinguish them from their longer counterparts with the same lemma and set of features.

#### Examples
* _ga_ ("him", variant of _njega_)
* _jih_ ("them", variant of _njih_)
* _jo_ ("her", variant of _njo_)
* _mi_ ("to me", variant of _meni_)
*_se_ ("oneself", used either as a variant of reflexive pronoun _sebi_ or as an obligatory free morpheme with pseudo-reflexive verbs, such as _smejati se_ "to laugh")
