In Naija, aspect is a lexical feature of [auxiliaries](pcm-pos/AUX) that specifies the duration and completion of processes in time.

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperfect

The imperfect aspect is used to indicate ongoing processes.

#### Example

* _you get blow out tire for road as you <b>dey</b> travel_ "you get a blown out tire on the road as you are travelling"

### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfect

The perfect aspect is used to indicate that a process occurred and was completed before the time under consideration. The focus may therefore be on the resulting state rather than on the event itself.

#### Example

* _im <b>don</b> happen_ "it has happened"
* _we <b>neva</b> eat_ "we haven't eaten"

### <a name="Real">`Real`</a>: realis


#### Example

* _tire go <b>come</b> burst_ "the tire would explode"
