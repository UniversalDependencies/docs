#### Description

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Irish numbers are split into three categories: cardinal, ordinal and personal. The personal form is used for counting people. All three forms differ in spelling.
