`Case` in Ka'apor may ...



### <a name="Aff">`Aff`</a>: Affected

The particle _ke_ signalizes that agent subjects are semantically affected by the event described by the verb and when 
objects are high on the animacy scale (Duarte 2019). Deviating from previous works, where it is usually marked as a particle,
it is here marked as `Case`. Affectedness menas, in this case, that Ka'apor exhibits direct object marking 
(DOM) and differential subject marking (DSM).

#### Examples

* _<b>some example</b>&nbsp;_ “some example” 
 










## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
