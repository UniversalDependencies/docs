`PRON` is used for English pronouns, such as _we_, _her_, _it_, _who_, and _that_ when used as a relative pronoun.

The English `PRON` corresponds to the PTB PRP, PRP$, WP, WP$, EX, and certain things that are tagged DT (question and *Wh* pronouns, such as *who*, *this*, and *that*), when they comprise a nominal by themselves rather than functioning as the determiner of a nominal head (usually a noun). (The assignment of PRP$ and WP$ to PRON might be subject to revision - they could also become DET.)
