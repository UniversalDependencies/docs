Definition

Degree of comparison is an inflectional feature of some [adjectives](ud/pos/ADJ) and [verb participles](ud/pos/VERB). A participle has to be tagged as <code>ADJ</code> in order to have the <code>Degree</code> feature.<br/>

Possible degrees:<br/>

### <a name="Pos">`Pos`</a>: positive

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something,
without comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this
degree is traditionally called "positive", negative properties can be
compared, too.

#### Examples

* _<b>suur</b> maja_ “big house”
* _<b>tuntud</b> poliitik_ “well-known politician”

### <a name="Cmp">`Cmp`</a>: comparative

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object.

#### Examples

* _<b>suurem</b> maja_ “bigger house”
* _<b>tuntum</b> poliitik_ “better-known politician”

### <a name="Sup">`Sup`</a>: superlative

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set.

#### Examples

* _<b>suurim</b> maja_ “the biggest house”
* _<b>tuntuim</b> poliitik_ “the best-known politician”
