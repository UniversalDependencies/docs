We distinguish two classes of verbs in Beja according to the work of M.Vanhove:

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: verb class 1

Verb class 1, historically the oldest one, is
conjugated with prefixes (and also infixes for disyllabic verbs in the singular). The root
of the verbs of this class is consonantal (one, two or three consonants), and the vowels of
the verb stem vary with TAM. Beja is the Cushitic language where this verb type is the
most frequent. It contains the majority of the verbs (56%, cf. Cohen 1984). The stem,
which forms the basis of the conjugation is, by convention, the bare form found in the
construction with the light verb auxiliary _di_ ‘say’, which is also that
of the Imperative without the inflectional morphemes. 

#### Examples
- _tak / kaːm =i / hoː kʷiɖ -ja <b>i- ni</b> //_ "A man <b>said</b>: "My camel disappeared." "

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: verb class 2

Verb class 2, the innovative paradigm, is conjugated with suffixes and the stem is
invariable for all TAM and corresponds to the root without the inflectional morphemes.
Verb class assignment is synchronically arbitrary, but most borrowings from Arabic are
conjugated following the V2 pattern. 

#### Examples
- _tak / kaːm =i / hoː <b>kʷiɖ</b> -ja i- ni //_ "A man said: "My camel <b>disappeared</b>." "
