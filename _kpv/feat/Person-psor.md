Person[psor]
is possessor's person, marked on Hungarian nouns. These noun
forms would be translated to English as possessive pronoun + noun.

This layered feature is conveniently used for possessive inflections
of nouns, although nouns normally do not have a `Person` feature,
meaning that no other layers are needed. Nevertheless, the possessive
morphology typically also includes `Number`, which must be multi-layered
on nouns, and we thus have `Person[psor]` together with `Number[psor]`.

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person possessor

#### Examples

* [kpv] _пон_ “dog”
* [kpv] _<b>понйӧй</b>_ “my dog”
* [kpv] _<b>понным</b>_ “our dog”

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person possessor

#### Examples

* [kpv] _пон_ “dog”
* [kpv] _<b>понйыд</b>_ “your.Sing dog”
* [kpv] _<b>понныд</b>_ “your.Plur dog”

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person possessor

#### Examples

* [kpv] _пон_ “dog”
* [kpv] _<b>понйыс</b>_ “his/her/its dog”
* [kpv] _<b>понныс</b>_ “their dog”
