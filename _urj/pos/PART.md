### Description

Particles are suggested to be avoided in Uralic treebanks altogether, for many
things called particles in Uralic grammars, [ADV](), [INTJ]() or [ADP]()
guidelines will provide better match. The following should be considered for
particles in Uralic languages:

* enclitic particles
* question particles
* focus particles
* negation particle when it's not a negation verb
