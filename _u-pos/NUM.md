### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner,
adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the
number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Note that cardinal numerals are covered by `NUM` whether they are used
as determiners or not (as in _Windows <b>Seven</b>_) and whether they
are expressed as words _(four)_, digits _(4)_ or Roman numerals
_(IV)_. Other words functioning as determiners (including quantifiers
such as _many_ and _few_) are tagged [DET]().

Note that there are words that may be traditionally called numerals in
some languages (e.g. Czech) but which are not tagged `NUM`. Such
non-cardinal numerals belong to other parts of speech in our universal
tagging scheme, based mainly on syntactic criteria: ordinal numerals
are [adjectives](ADJ) _(first, second, third)_ or [adverbs](ADV) ([cs]
_poprv√©_ "for the first time"), multiplicative numerals are adverbs
_(once, twice)_ etc.

### Examples

- _0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2014, 1000000, 3.14159265359_
- _one, two, three, seventy-seven_
- _I, II, III, IV, V, MMXIV_
