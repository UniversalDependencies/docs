Case is an inflectional feature of nouns and other parts of speech (adjectives, verbs, articles) that mark agreement with nouns.

In Irish four cases are used: common (which covers nominative and accusative case), vocative, genitive and dative. These cases are labelled respectively as `NomAcc`, `Voc`, `Gen`, and `Dat`.

### `NomAcc` : common case

The common case is the base form of the noun, and is used for the lemma.
This word form is used for subjects and objects of a clause, and predicates of a copula.

#### Examples

##### Subjects:
* _Tosóidh an <b>cheolchoirm</b> ar 8pm_ "The <b>concert</b> will start at 8pm"
* _Bhris an <b>bord</b> ina dhá leath_ "The <b>board</b> broke into two halves"

##### Objects:
* _Cuireann Paul an <b>píosa</b> seo chugainn_ "Paul offers this <b>piece</b> to us"
* _D'ith sí an <b>dinnéar</b>_ "She ate the <b>dinner</b>"

##### Predicates:
* _Is <b>láithreán</b> uafásach é seo_ "This is an awful <b>site</b>"
* _Is <b>múinteoir</b> é_ "He is a <b>teacher</b>"

### `Voc` : vocative case

The vocative case is used to mark a noun as being the addresse. It is preceded by the particle `a` (see [PartType]()). The vocative case triggers lenition.

#### Examples

* _'Slán leat, <b>a</b> D<b>h</b>oráid!_ "Goodbye, Dorád!"
* _<b>A</b> d<b>h</b>aoine uaisle_ "ladies and gentlemen"

### `Gen` : genitive case

The genitive case indicates possesion or ownership. Its use is similar to the use of <b>'s</b> in English. Other use cases include describing the composition of an object, compound nouns, objects of a compound preposition, and objects of a verbal noun (see [VerbForm]()).

#### Examples

* _dearadh an <b>stáitse</b>_ "outlook of the state"
* _mac an <b>fhir</b>_ "the man's son (lit. son of the man)"
* _an Aontas <b>Eorpaigh</b>_ "the European Union"

### `Dat` : dative case

The dative case is used with most simple prepositions in Irish. In standard Irish, the dative form is identical to the common case.

#### Examples

* _in <b>Eireann</b>_ "in Ireland"
* _sa <b>leabhair</b>_ "in the book"
