### Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word
or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of
other universal parts of speech (e.g. [adpositions](ADP),
[coordinating conjunctions](CCONJ), [subordinating conjunctions](SCONJ)
or [auxiliary verbs](AUX)).  Particles may encode grammatical
categories such as negation, mood, tense etc. Russian particles are
not inflected.

Note that response words such as _да&nbsp;_ “yes”, _нет&nbsp;_ “no”, etc.
are considered particles in the PDT tagset but they should be retagged
as interjections under the UD standard. 

### Examples

- Sentence modality: _<b>пусть</b>&nbsp;_ (“<b>May you</b> have an enjoyable stay!”)
- _же&nbsp;_ “just, only” 
- _аж&nbsp;_ “as late as, even, up to” 
  Use case: _Мне сегодня аж пять писем пришло.&nbsp;_ “Today I have recieved even five letters”
