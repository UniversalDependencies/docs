### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: clitic pronoun

Galician has clitic pronouns, syntactic independent morphemes which depend phonologically on a verb. They may be proclitic (_Non <b>vos</b> sinto_, "I don't hear you<sub>(plural)</sub>") or enclitic (_Sínto<b>vos</b>_, "I hear you<sub>plural</sub>"), and several clitic pronouns may be attached to the same verb (_Dixéron<b>volo</b>_, dixeron+vos+o). Note that except for proclitics, pronouns are orthographically attached to the verb, in contrast to Portuguese spelling (_quéro<b>te</b>_ vs _quero-<b>te</b>_).

#### Examples

* _díxo<b>lles</b>_ "[(s)he] told them"
* _Non <b>te</b> ouviu_ "[(s)he] did not hear you"
