### Definition

Czech has only prepositions but no postpositions or circumpositions.
They occur before a complement noun phrase
(noun, pronoun)
and they form a single structure with the complement to express its
grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.

Some prepositions take the form of fixed multiword expressions, e.g.
_na rozdíl od&nbsp;_ “in contrast to”, _v&nbsp;souvislosti s&nbsp;_
“in connection with”. The
component words are then still tagged according to their basic use
(_na&nbsp;_ is `ADP`, _rozdíl&nbsp;_ is [NOUN](), etc.) and their status as
multiword expressions are accounted for in the syntactic annotation.

### Examples

- _v&nbsp;_ “in, at”
- _k&nbsp;_ “to”
- _během&nbsp;_ “during”
