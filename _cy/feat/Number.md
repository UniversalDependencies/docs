Number has two values in Welsh, Singular and Plural. It is marked on nouns, some adjectives, pronouns, verbs and inflected prepositions. Only very few adjectives are marked for number.
Verbs with a pronominal subject are marked for Person and Number, verbs with a nominal subject 
are always in the 3rd person singular, also with plural subjects.
There is a group of nouns in Welsh, whose lemma is a plural, the singular is formed by adding a singulative suffix: _plant_ "children", _plentyn_ "child"). However, in the Welsh treebank, we always put the singular in the lemma column
