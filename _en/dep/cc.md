A coordination is the relation between an element of a conjunct and the coordinating conjunction word of the conjunct.  (Note: different dependency grammars have different treatments of coordination.  We take one conjunct of a conjunction (normally the first) as the head of the conjunction.) A conjunction may also appear at the beginning of a sentence.  This is also called a `cc`, and dependent on the root predicate of the sentence.
