# How to contribute to UD

* If you want to use UD treebanks, [download](http://universaldependencies.org#download) them from LINDAT/CLARIN to make sure you get the latest official version.
  If you prefer taking the data from their Github repositories, make sure you work with the master branch, which corresponds to the latest official release.

* If you want to give feedback on UD guidelines or treebanks, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/universaldependencies/docs/issues).
  Any issues related to documentation and guidelines, even specific to one language, belong to the issue tracker of the docs repository.
  Issue trackers of individual treebank repositories should be used only to report bugs in those treebanks.
  You can also send an e-mail to the [UD mailing list](http://stp.lingfil.uu.se/mailman/listinfo/ud); however, the list is primarily meant for announcements for data maintainers.

* If you want to start a treebank or contribute to a release, please follow the steps in the [release checklist](release_checklist.html).

  * Some more advice for those who want to start a treebank of a new language and do not know [how to start](how_to_start.html).
  * If you do not want to commit to maintaining a treebank but you want to help fix a particular bug in the data, you can submit a pull request against the dev branch.

* If you want to contribute to language-specific documentation, follow these [guidelines](contributing_language_specific.html).

Please consider subscribing to the [UD mailing list](http://stp.lingfil.uu.se/mailman/listinfo/ud), <strong>especially if you are going to contribute data.</strong> Important announcements for the data providers are circulated through this list.
