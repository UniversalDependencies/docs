Boolean feature of verbs ([VERB]() and [AUX]()), marking a word as
being in connegative form.

In Karelian, negations are formed of the auxiliary negative verb (*ei*)
and the main verb, the latter of which typically appears in
connegative form.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: word is connegative

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not connegative, the
`Connegative` feature will not appear.
