## NUM

### Definition

A numeral is a word functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, 
such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Note that cardinal numerals are covered by `NUM` whether they are used as determiners or not (as in _Windows <b>Seven</b>_) and whether 
they are expressed as words _(four)_, digits _(4)_ or Roman numerals _(IV)_.
Other words functioning as determiners (including quantifiers such as _many_ and _few_) are tagged [DET](DET.md).


Νon-cardinal numerals belong to other parts of speech: 
- ordinal numerals  (_porv_ / _birinǧí_ "first", _ikinǧí_ "second" etc.) are assigned the tag [ADJ](ADJ.md)
- multiplicative numerals (_annóš_ "once", _dvaš_ "twice") are assigned the tag [ADV](ADV.md)

#### Examples

- _0_, _1_, _2_, _3_, _4_, _5_, _2014_, _1000000_, _3.14159265359_
- _annó_, _dve_, _tri, _on beš_ "one, two, three, fifteen"
- _I_, _II_, _III_, _IV_, _V_, _MMXIV_
