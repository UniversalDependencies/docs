Voice is a feature of verbs that helps map the traditional syntactic functions,
such as subject and object, to semantic roles, such as agent and patient.



### <a name="Pass">`Pass`</a>: passive voice

The subject of the verb is affected by the action (patient).

In Kyrgyz a (transitive) verb may get two passive affixes (see below), and intransitive verb may also be passivized.

Similarly a single passive affix on an intransitive verb also
indicates impersonal passive.
The verb's valency is reduced to zero with impersonal passives constructions,
the verb cannot have a subject.

#### Examples

* _ Үй сыр<b>дал</b>ган._  "The house was painted"
* _Бул жерден бирөө жыг<b>ыл</b>ышы мүмкүн._ "One may fall from here" (impersonal, intransitive verb passivized)


### <a name="Cau">`Cau`</a>: causative voice

In causative constructions the subject is the entity "causing" the action. It generally translate to English as 'cause/make/have/let/allow' someone to perform action described by the main verb.

#### Examples

* _ Дениз уктатылды._  "Deniz was made to sleep."
