### Definition

An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a
verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the
lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality.
In Beja it may be a verb or an affix and we have tagged the clitic copulas as such.

### Examples

- _uːn uː= kaːm iraːnaj / fidig -a <b>dʔi</b> -jaː =b =u /_ "Gosh, this camel was let loose [and]"
- _hoː =b hoːsoː ʃʔag -aː =b <b>=u</b> uː= tak _ "The man was carrying on his shoulder a lamb"
