Person is relevant for determiners, pronouns, auxiliaries and verbs. We also apply the feature Person[psor] to denote the person of the possessor on nominal elements.

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons.

#### Examples

* [hu] _<b>alszom</b>_ “<b>I</b> sleep”

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the
utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and
optionally some third persons too.

#### Examples

* [hu] _<b>alszol</b>_ “<b>you</b> sleep”

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither
speakers nor addressees.

#### Examples

* [hu] _<b>alszik</b>_ “<b>he sleeps</b>”
