### Definition

A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents
without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses a semantic
relationship between them.

Some coordinating conjunctions appear in pairs or groups of more than one:
[fi] _sekä_ ... _että_ "both ... and".

#### Co-ordination and enclitic particles

Many Uralic languages have enclitic particles that are used in co-ordination
in addition to or instead of specific words. It is recommended but not required
to encode such enclitics as multiword tokens with a CCONJ part.

#### Examples

* [fi] _ja_ "and", _tai_ "or", _vai_ "or", _sekä_ "and", _mutta_ "but"
* [fi] _eikä_ "and not", _enkä_ "and I do not"
