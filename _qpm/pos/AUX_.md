## AUX

### Definition

An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried 
by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality.  It is often a verb (which may have non-auxiliary 
uses as well) but many languages have nonverbal TΙME markers and these should also be tagged [AUX](). The class [AUX]() also include copulas 
(in the narrow sense of pure linking words for nonverbal predication).

In Pomak the verbs broadly translated as "to be" are assigned the tag [AUX]():

#### Examples

- _som / si / je / sme / ste / so_ "to be"
    * _ja som at Púlevo i zavót mo Ridván_ "I am/come from Púlevo and my name is Ritvan"
    * _sélono je visóce faf barčínono_ "my village is (located) high up in the mountain"
    * _dečjána ji so míčky_ "her children are small / young"
    * _atišlála je nah májko ji da jé abíde_ "she went/ has gone to her mother to visit her"	
    * _svaríla je játo za vritsǽh_ "she cooked / has cooked food for all (of us / the people /her family)"
    * _légnali so da pačínnot málko_ "they laid down / have laid down to rest a little"

    * _nó kutrí čúka na vratána, bába še by_ "someone knocks on the door, it must be [your] grand-mother"
    * _gládni šte by - da vú svárem li nǽko da kósnete?_ "you must be hungry - shall I make you something to eat?"
    * _pó húbbe še by da ídete i dvomínata_ "it would be better for both of you to go" - [lit. "better it would be to go and the two"] 
    * _za bú senǽ svóršahme, dagodíno 'sæ pak, akú býde kysmét_ "for this year we have finished, again next year, if it is ment to be" [lit."for this year we finished, next year again, if it is written"] - 
    * _néma go u tæh, atišlól še by pa komšújese_ "he is not at home, he must have gone to [someone of] the neighbors"

- the interrogative word _li / dalí_ "question particle" (necessary to form direct questions)
    * _ažónen li si?_ "are you married?" [lit. "married you?"]
    * _dalí dójdom i ja sas vámi?_ "should I come with you?" [lit. "come and I with you?"


The auxiliary verb <i><b>want</b> (probabilistic will - would)</i> `šom / štom, ti / šteš, še / šte, šem / šme, šte, šot / štot` is assigned the tag
`AUX`.


#### Examples

* _déti so i praví / starí <b>šot / štot</b> síčko_ "they are children and they could do everything /anything"
* _kupí tó <b>še / šte</b> i predá tó <b>še / šte</b> i tébe_ "he /she could buy and sell you, too"
* _attí <b>šem / šme</b> i da lýǧeno, akú nájdeme tomofíle_ "we would go / we would be able to go even to the thermal baths, if we could find a car" 
* _račí li <b>ti / šteš</b> da paminéš prez 'túzi, agá so púsneš ad rábato?_ "would you want / accept to pass by here, when you finish from your work?" 
* _da mú <b>šom / štom</b> i parý, akú znom óti še sí mí gi vórne_ "I would give him money as well, if I knew that he would return them" 
* _attí šte i varná só šte, ímate vréme_ "you shall go and come back, you have (enough) time" 

_Modal verbs_ count as [main verbs](VERB.md) and are assigned the tag [VERB](VERB.md).

#### Examples

* _trǽbava da sí vórvem_ "I must leave - I must be going" 
* _móža da dójde i toj_ "he can also come - he may come, too"
