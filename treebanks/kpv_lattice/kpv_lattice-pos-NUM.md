## Morphology

The form / lemma ratio of `NUM` is 1.000000 (the average of all parts of speech is 1.256410).

The 1st highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “кык”: <em>кык</em>.

The 2nd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “нёль”: <em>нёль</em>.

The 3rd highest number of forms (1) was observed with the lemma “ӧти”: <em>ӧти</em>.

`NUM` occurs with 3 features: <tt><a href="kpv_lattice-feat-NumType.html">NumType</a></tt> (7; 100% instances), <tt><a href="kpv_lattice-feat-Case.html">Case</a></tt> (2; 29% instances), <tt><a href="kpv_lattice-feat-Number.html">Number</a></tt> (2; 29% instances)

`NUM` occurs with 4 feature-value pairs: `Case=Nom`, `NumType=Card`, `NumType=Card,Ord`, `Number=Sing`

`NUM` occurs with 3 feature combinations.
The most frequent feature combination is `NumType=Card` (5 tokens).
Examples: <em>ӧти, нёль, кык</em>


## Relations

`NUM` nodes are attached to their parents using 2 different relations: <tt><a href="kpv_lattice-dep-nummod.html">nummod</a></tt> (6; 86% instances), <tt><a href="kpv_lattice-dep-nmod.html">nmod</a></tt> (1; 14% instances)
