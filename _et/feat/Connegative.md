Boolean feature of verbs ([VERB]() and [AUX]()), marking a word as
being in connegative form.

In Estonian, negations are formed of the auxiliary negative verb (*ei*)
and the main verb, the latter of which typically appears in
connegative form.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: word is connegative

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not connegative, the
`Connegative` feature will not appear.

#### Examples

* [et] _ei <b>tea</b>_ "I don't <b>know</b>"
* [et] _ära <b>mängi</b>!_ "Don't <b>play</b>!"
* [et] _ta ei <b>loe</b> ega <b>kirjuta</b>_ "He doesn't <b>read</b> or <b>write</b>"
