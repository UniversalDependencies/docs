### Definition

Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context.

Since Japanese does not have a specific class of posessive personal pronoun, 
_我が&nbsp;_ “my” is classified into [ADJ]() as well as other words in the same class in UniDic, 
instead of labeling [DET]() or [PRON]().


### Examples

- personal pronouns (1st person): _<b>私</b>, <b>我</b>, <b>拙者</b>, ...&nbsp;_ “I” (`pronoun` / 代名詞)
- personal pronouns (2nd person): _<b>あなた</b>, <b>君</b>, <b>貴殿</b>，...&nbsp;_ “you” (`pronoun` / 代名詞)
- personal pronouns (3rd person): _<b>彼</b>_ “he”, _<b>彼女</b>_  “she” (`pronoun` / 代名詞)
- interrogative pronouns:_<b>何</b>_ “what”, _<b>誰</b>_ “who”, _<b>いつ</b>_ “when”, _<b>どこ</b>_ “where” (`pronoun` / 代名詞)
- _<b>ここ</b>_ “here”, _<b>そこ</b>&nbsp;_ “there” (`pronoun` / 代名詞)
