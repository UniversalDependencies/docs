A copula is the relation between the complement of a copular verb and the copular verb *være* "to be". The copula is treated as a dependent of the lexical verb.

~~~ sdparse
Det er ovnsbakt piggvar \n It is ovenbaked turbot
cop(piggvar, er)
~~~

This analysis entails that in copula clauses, the main predicate is not verbal, but rather an adjectival or even nominal (as in the above example).

Note that there are occurrences of *være* "to be" which do not give rise to a copula analysis, such as in cleft constructions (see [expl](expl)).
