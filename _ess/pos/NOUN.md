### Definition

Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea.

### Examples

- _nengyugh-_ "granmother (base)",
- _nengyuqa_ "my grandmother"
- _nengyunllu_ "your grandmother"

If a word is further analyzed into morphemes, noun-yielding derivational morphemes are tagged as `NOUN`. These include noun-elaborating suffixes (N→N) that attach to nominal roots and yield nominal bases and nominalizing suffixes (V→N) that attach to verbal roots and yield nominal bases.

### Examples

- _-ghllag(N→N)_ "big N" (as in _sikigllaget_ "big squirrels")
- _-ngugh(V→N)_ "one that is V" (as in _kavilnguq_ "one that is red")

The `NOUN` tag is intended for common nouns only. See [PRON]() for pronouns.
