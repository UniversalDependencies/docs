Boolean feature of verbs ([VERB]() and [AUX]()), marking a word as
being in connegative form.

In Erzya, some negations are formed combining the auxiliary past (first preterit) negative verb (*эзь*), the conjunctive auxiliary negative verb (*аволь*), the prohibitive auxiliary negative verb (*иля*), or the converb/participle negative auxiliary (*апак*)
and the main verb, the latter of which appears in the connegative form.

### Yes: word is connegative

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not connegative, the
`Connegative` feature will not appear.

#### Examples

* [myv] _эзинь <b>сода</b>_ "I didn't <b>know</b>"
* [myv] _эзия <b>сае</b>_ "I didn't <b>take</b> it"

* [myv] _аволинь <b>сода</b>_ "I wouldn't <b>know</b>"

* [myv] _иляк <b>сае</b>_ "Don't <b>take</b> it"

* [myv] _апак <b>сода</b>_ "un-<b>known</b> (Conv/Part)"
