A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger
constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and
expresses a semantic relationship between them.

For *subordinating* conjunctions, see [SCONJ]().

In correlative (paired) coordinating conjuctions such as _sekä - että_
"both - and" and _joko - tai_ "either - or", both words are annotated
`CCONJ` (see also [cc:preconj]()).

#### Examples

* [fi] _ja_ "and", _tai_ "or", _mutta_ "but"
* [fi] _<b>sekä</b> koirat <b>että</b> kissat_ "<b>both</b> dogs <b>and</b> cats"
