Aspect

Aspect is a feature that specifies duration of the action in time,
whether the action has been completed etc.

In Bulgarian aspect is a lexical feature, as in other Slavic languages.
It comprises two grammemes: _perfective_ and _imperfective_.

### `Imp`: imperfect aspect

The action took / takes / will take some time span and there is no
information whether and when it was / will be completed.

#### Examples

- казвам / _kazvam_ "say"
- намирам / _namiram_ "find"
- разбирам / _razbiram_ "understand"

### `Perf`: perfect aspect

The action has been / will have been completed. Since there is
emphasis on one point on the time scale (the point of completion),
this aspect does not work well with the present tense for actual activities. 

#### Examples

- кажа / _kazha_ "say"
- намеря / _namerya_ "find"
- разбера / _razbera_ "understand"
