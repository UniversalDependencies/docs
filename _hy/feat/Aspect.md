Aspect is a feature that specifies duration of the action in time,
whether the action has been completed etc. In Armenian some tenses are actually combinations of tense and aspect. 

Note, that some aspectual meanings in (secondary) compound tenses may be expressed at participles.

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperfect aspect

The action took / takes / will take some time span and there is no
information whether and when it was / will be completed.

#### Examples

* _<b>վազում</b> եմ տուն&nbsp;_ “I run / am running home”,
* _<b>վազում</b> էի տուն&nbsp;_ “I was running home”

### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfect aspect

The action has been / will have been completed. Since there is
emphasis on one point on the time scale (the point of completion),
this aspect does not work well with the present tense.

The forms with resultative participles might better be defined as ‘perfect stative’.

#### Examples

* _<b>վազեցի</b> տուն&nbsp;_ “I ran home”,
* _<b>վազել</b> եմ տուն&nbsp;_ “I have run home”,
* _<b>վազել</b> էի տուն&nbsp;_ “I had run home”,
* _<b>նստած </b> եմ տանը&nbsp;_ “I am sitting at home”,
* _<b>նստած </b> էի տանը&nbsp;_ “I was sitting at home”

### <a name="Prosp">`Prosp`</a>: prospective aspect

In general, prospective aspect can be described as relative future:
the action is/was/will be expected to take place at a moment that
follows the reference point; the reference point itself can be
in past, present or future.

In some contexts subjunctive and conditional forms may also indicate prospective aspect and signal an event that expected to take place. `Prosp` meaning prevails in conditional imperfect forms.

The future-II participle also indicate progressive aspect.

#### Examples

* _<b>վազելու</b> եմ տուն&nbsp;_ “I shall run home”,
* _<b>վազելու</b> էի տուն&nbsp;_ “I should run home”,
* _<b>վազեմ</b> տուն&nbsp;_ “(I'd better) run home”,
* _<b>վազեի</b> տուն&nbsp;_ “I wish I ran home”
* _<b>կվազեմ</b> տուն&nbsp;_ “I shall run home”,
* _<b>կվազեի</b> տուն&nbsp;_ “I shall run home”
* _<b>կառուցվելիք</b> շենք&nbsp;_ “a house that will be built”
* _<b>հնչելիք</b> զանգ&nbsp;_ “a call that will ring”

### <a name="Prog">`Prog`</a>: progressive aspect

Action is in progress with respect to current or a reference time. The converb indicate progressive aspect.

#### Examples

* _<b>վազելիս</b> ընկա&nbsp;_ “I fell while running”
* _<b>վազելիս</b> ընկնում եմ&nbsp;_ “I am falling while running”
* _<b>վազելիս</b> ընկնեի&nbsp;_ “(I wish) I would have fallen while running”

### <a name="Dur">`Dur`</a>: durative aspect

A situation or action that has persisted over a period of time and still continues.

The subject participle indicate durative aspect.

#### Examples

* _<b>կառուցվող</b> շենք&nbsp;_ “a house, that is being built”
* _<b>հնչող</b> զանգ&nbsp;_ “a call that ringed”

### <a name="Iter">`Iter`</a>: iterative

Denotes repeated action, with multiplicative or distributive meanings. Armenian has three main iterative markers _-ատ&nbsp;, -ոտ&nbsp;, -տ&nbsp;_ or _root reduplication_.

Note, that in Armenian iterative is considered as a lexical feature of [verbs](VERB), thus they have morphologically related not iterative counterparts, but it is not a regular system and the two verbs are represented by different lemmas. We mark them as biaspectual.

#### Examples

* _ցատկել&nbsp;_ “jump”, _<b>ցատկոտել</b>&nbsp;_ “jump several times”,
* _կտրել&nbsp;_ “cut”, _<b>կտրատել</b>&nbsp;_ “chop, cut in pieces”,
* _փնտրել&nbsp;_ “search”, _<b>փնտրտել</b>&nbsp;_ “search several times”,
* _վազել&nbsp;_ “to run”, _<b>վազվզել</b>&nbsp;_ “to run around, to run often”
