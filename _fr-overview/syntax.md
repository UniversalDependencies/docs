# Syntax

The syntactic annotation in the French UD treebank follows the general guidelines but adds two language-specific relations:

- _acl:relcl_ for relative clauses
- _nmod:poss_ for possessive

The syntactic annotation has been automatically converted from the original Google universal annotation scheme. The following phenomena are known to deviate from the general guidelines and will be fixed in future versions:

The _remnant_ analysis of ellipsis, as well as the _vocative_, _goeswith_, _reparandum_, _dislocated_ and _list_ analyses have not been fully implemented.
