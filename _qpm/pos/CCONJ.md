## CCONJ

### Definition

A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses
a semantic relationship between them.

<b>Single coordinating conjunction</b>

#### Examples

- _alá_ "but", _légnah ráno, alá na mažýh da záspem_ "I went to bed early, but I could not fall asleep" 
- _am_ / _áma / _amá_ "but", _še dójdom, amá ne le isǽ - málko pó sétne_ "I shall come, but not now, just a little later" 

<b>Repetitive conjunction. These usually contain at least two parts.</b>

#### Examples

* _hem... hem..._ "either... or...", _fčéra hem letǽšo hem dúješo_  - "yesterday it was both rainy and windy" [lit."yesterday it was raining and it also had wind"]
* _níta / níto... níta / níto..._ "neither... nor...", _níta ty mí trǽbavaš níta drug - i samýj móžom da sí je stórem rábatono_ "I do not need either you or anyone else - since I can do my work on my own" [lit "neither you serve to me, nor another - and alone I can do my work"

<b>Single and repetitive conjunction. These usually are used as singletons, but they also might be used in a repetitive chain.</b>

#### Examples

- _i_ "and", _samýj sí varí i peré_ "he does both cooking and washing on his own"  [lit. "alone he cooks and washes"]
- _i... i..._ "and... and...", _i játo mí svaríh i vódo mí annésah i kahvǿ mí stórih_ "I cooked them food and I took them water and
 I served them coffee (as well)" [lit. "and food them I cooked and water them I took and coffee them I made"]
