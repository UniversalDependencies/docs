In Welsh, `VerbForm` is marked on verbs and can take one of the two following values:

- Fin: finite verb
- FinRel: relative form of a finite verb (_sydd_ (_bod_)
- Vnoun: verb noun


### <a name="Fin">`Fin`</a>: finite verb

#### Examples

* _Mi **welodd** geffyl_ “She saw a horse”



### <a name="FinRel">`FinRel`</a>: finite verb for relative clauses

#### Examples

the auxiliary _bod_ has a special form in the 3rd person singular present tense, which can aonly be used in relative clauses

* _Mae hi'n gweld ceffyl **sy**'n rhedeg_ “She is seeing a horse which is running”


### <a name="Vnoun">`Vnoun`</a>: verb noun

The only non finite form of Welsh verbs is the verb noun. It functions as a noun, i.e. it has no direct object but a genitive noun modifier. In contrast to (indefinite) direct objects of finit verbs, the genitive noun modifier is not mutated

#### Examples

* _Mae hi'n **gweld** ceffyl_ "She is seeing a horse"
