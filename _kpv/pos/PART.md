Komi-Zyrian has several particles, many of which are etymologically of Russian origin. 

## Native Komi particles

### Ordinary particles

- _мися_
- _пӧ_ Expresses suspicion towards the statement
- _со_ A focus particle
- _эськӧ_

### Existential particles

Following particles are used in existential sentences:

- _эм_ "particle used in existential sentences"
- _выйым_ "dialectal variant of _эм_" 
- _абу_ "particle that expresses negation in the existential sentences, but also in other constructions, see discussion about [copulas](cop)"

They also have plural forms: эмӧсь, выйымесь, абуӧсь. This makes their analysis as particles somewhat problematic, and the analysis is subject to possible changes in later revisions. 

## Russian particles

These are tagged as particles also in Russian treebank, although the exact use may differ in subtle ways. For example, _но_ in Russian is not considered a particle, but occasional particle-like use in Komi corresponds closely to Russian _ну_. _Но_ is also used in Komi as CCONJ.

- _вед_
- _вот_
- _да_ This possibly should be tagged as INTJ
- _жӧ_
- _значит_ In Russian this is analysed as verb, but within Komi system it doesn't exhibit any morphology. 
- _и_
- _ли_
- _не_
- _ни_
- _но_
- _нӧ_
- _ну_
- _ӧд_ Variant of вед, which originates from ведь 
- _тай_
- _так_
- _то_
- _тожӧ_
