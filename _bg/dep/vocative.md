The vocative relation is used to mark a dialogue participant addressed in a text (common in conversations, dialogue, emails, newsgroup postings, etc.). The relation links the addressee’s name to its host sentence. If the nominal is clearly vocative in intent, the preference is to use the vocative relation. 

In Bulgarian some proper and common names have a morphologically marked vocative form. The others use the nominative form.
