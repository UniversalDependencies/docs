The `flat` relation is one of three relations for multiword expressions (MWEs) in UD (the other two being fixed and compound). It is used for exocentric (headless) structures like names and dates. The head of the relation is always the first word of the expression, while all the other words in the expression are its dependents. In the Slovene treebank three different varieties of the **flat** relation are used.

The more general **flat** relation is used for individual tokens that make up **dates and multi-word numerals**.

Finally, the 'flat' relation is also used for some verbatim transcriptions in speech, such as spelled-out numbers, acronyms, or URL addresses, which would typically be written with different symbols in writing.
