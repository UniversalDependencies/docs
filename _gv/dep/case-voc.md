A vocative particle precedes and marks the case of an addressee.
This subtype is also used in the Irish treebank. The vocative
particle is very often omitted in Manx, even in contexts where
it would be obligatory, or least expected, in Irish.

### Example

~~~ sdparse
Dy bannee dhyt y Voirrey \n May bless to-you VOC Mary
case:voc(Voirrey, y)
vocative(bannee, Voirrey)
~~~

But the particle is omitted in examples like these:

~~~ sdparse
Ettyl-jee ersooyl , ushagyn ! \n Fly away , birds !
vocative(Ettyl-jee, ushagyn)
~~~
