This relation specifies a clausal subject of a copular clause whose predicate is itself a clause, 
to signal that it is not the subject of the nested clause.
See discussion of [Predicate Clauses](../overview/complex-clauses.html#predicate-clauses).

The nominal counterpart of this relation is [nsubj:outer]().

The `:outer` subtype is *not* intended for most clausal subjects of copular clausesâ€”only those where the predicate is itself a clause. 
Plain [csubj]() (or another subtype) will be appropriate if the copular clause predicate is a nominal, adjective, etc.:
