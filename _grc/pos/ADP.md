### Definition

Adposition is a cover term to include both prepositions and postpositions, i.e., invariable words specifying the function of a nominal with respect to, prototypically, a verb (or adjective). in Ancient Greek most adpositions are prepositions. Adpositions can also, especially in Homeric poetry, function as adverbs: it is sometimes very hard to decide whether they are adverbs or adpostions.

### Prepositions

A list of prepositions and an overview on their functions can be found in Smyth 1920: <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Smyth+grammar+1636&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0007" target="_blank">365</a>-<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Smyth+grammar+1702&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0007" target="_blank">388</a>.

#### Examples

* <b>_ἀπὸ_</b> _θαλάσσης_ "from the sea" (T. 1.7) 
* <b>_δι(ά)᾽_</b> _ὤμου_ "through (the) shoulder" (Il. 4.481) 
* <b>_περὶ_</b> _πατρίδος_ "for (the) country" (T. 6.69)


### Postpositions

In antiquity postpositions were considered to be prepositions which can also in some genre/author appear after their dependents: this is known as an example of anastrophe (Smyth 1920: <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Smyth+grammar+175&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0007" target="_blank">40</a>-<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Smyth+grammar+175&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0007" target="_blank">41</a>; note that accent in dissyllabic prepositions is shifted back). Postpositions especially - but not exclusively - occur in poetry.

#### Examples

* _τούτων_ <b>_πἐρι_</b> "about these things"
