The parataxis relation is a relation between a word (often the main predicate of a sentence) and other elements, such as a sentential parenthetical or a clause after a “:” or a “;”, placed side by side without any explicit coordination, subordination, or argument relation with the head word. 

The Norwegian `parataxis` relation is largely used for reported speech and some other parentheticals.
