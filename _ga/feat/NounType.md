In Irish, noun forms fall into certain groups or declentions (see [Form]()). These nouns follow patterns of inflection depending on gender, number and case. The noun type feature affects the form of modifying adjectives, and so is a feature of both parts of speech.

### `Strong` : strong plurals

The form of a strong plural remains unchanged regardless of grammatical case, i.e. it does not inflect.

#### Examples
 
* _bláthanna_ “flowers” (nominative, accusative, genitive)
* _oibreacha_ “works” (nominative, accusative, genitive)
* _cótaí_ “coats” (nominative, accusative, genitive)

### `Weak` : weak plurals

Unlike the strong plural, a weak plural noun is different in the nominative, accusative and genitive cases.

#### Examples

* _focail_ “words” (nominative, accusative)
* _focal_ “words” (genitive)
* _Aontais_ “Unions” (nominative, accusative)
* _Aontas_ “Unions” (genitive)

Adjectives in Irish can have endings that are slender or not slender (broad). Depending on how the preceding noun ends, the form of the adjective can change.

### `NotSlender` : broad consonants
A final consonant is termed broad if the preceding vowel is broad (a, á, o, ó, u, ú). The feature 'NotSlender' applies to adjectives qualifying a plural noun that ends in a broad consonant or a vowel.

#### Examples

* _dath<b>a</b>nna príomhúla_
* _n<b>ó</b>taí praiticiúla_

### `Slender` : slender consonants

A final consonant is termed slender if the preceding vowel is slender (e, é, i, í). The feature 'Slender' applies to adjectives qualifying a plural noun that ends in a slender consonant.

#### Examples

* _na heagra<b>i</b>s dheonacha_
* _thua<b>i</b>the cháilitheacha_
