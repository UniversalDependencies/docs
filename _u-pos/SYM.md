### Definition

A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function, or both.

Many symbols are or contain special non-alphanumeric characters, similarly to <a href="PUNCT.html">punctuation</a>.
What makes them different from punctuation is that they can be substituted by normal words.
This involves all currency symbols, e.g. _$ 75_ is identical to _seventy-five dollars_.

Mathematical operators form another group of symbols.

Another group of symbols is emoticons and emoji.

Strings that consists entirely of alphanumeric characters are not symbols but they may be <a href="PROPN">proper nouns:</a>
_130XE_, _DC10_; others may be tagged PROPN (rather than SYM) even if they contain special characters: _DC-10_.

Characters used as bullets in itemized lists _(•, ‣)_ are not symbols, they are punctuation.
