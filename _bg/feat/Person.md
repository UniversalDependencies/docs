Person

Person is typically feature of personal and possessive
[pronouns](u-pos/PRON), and of [verbs](u-pos/VERB). On verbs it is in
fact an agreement feature that marks the person of the verb's subject. Person
marked on verbs makes it unnecessary to always add a personal pronoun
as subject and thus subjects are sometimes dropped (pro-drop
languages).

Bulgarian is a pro-drop language, as other Slavic languages.

### `1`: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons.

#### Examples

- аз / _az_ "I"
- идвам / _idvam_ "I am coming"

### `2`: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the
utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and
optionally some third persons too.

#### Examples

- ти / _ti_ "you"
- идваш / _idvash_ "You are coming"

### `3`: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither
speakers nor addressees.

#### Examples

- той, тя, то / _toy, tya, to_ "he, she, it"
- идва / _idva_ "He/she/it is coming"
