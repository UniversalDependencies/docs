The root of the utterance, that word, which depends on no other word. Usually this is the predicate, a verb if available, otherwise the nominal predicate of a nominal sentence: 

~~~ sdparse
ⲁⲛⲅ/PRON ⲡⲁ/PRON ⲡⲁⲩⲗⲟⲥ/PROPN \n I am of Paul

root(ⲡⲁ)
nsubj(ⲡⲁ, ⲁⲛⲅ)
nmod(ⲡⲁ, ⲡⲁⲩⲗⲟⲥ)
~~~

In fragments, such as a plain nominal phrase or a single interjection, the local root (i.e. the noun head, or the interjection) is the root.
