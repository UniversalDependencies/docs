A marker is the word introducing a finite clause subordinate to
another clause. For a [complement clause](ccomp), this is words like [en] _that_
or _whether._ For an [adverbial clause](advcl), the marker is typically a
[subordinating conjunction](../pos/SCONJ) like [en] _while_ or _although._ The mark is a dependent of the
subordinate clause head. In a relative clause, it is a normally uninflected word, which simply introduces a relative clause, such as [he] še. (In this last use, one needs to distinguish between relative clause markers, which are `mark` from relative pronouns, which fill a regular verbal argument or modifier grammatical relation.
