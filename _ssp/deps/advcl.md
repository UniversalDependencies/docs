An adverbial clause modifier is a clause which modifies a verb or other predicate (adjective, etc.) as a modifier, not as a core complement. This includes things like temporal, conditional and purpose clauses, etc. The dependent must be clausal (or else it is an [advmod]()) and the dependent is the main predicate of the clause. If the modifier is a nominal, the relation is that of [obl]().
