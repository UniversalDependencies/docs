Degree of comparison is typically an inflectional feature of some [adjectives](u-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](u-pos/ADV).

In Tatar, the comparative degree of an adjective or adverb is marked by the suffix _-рак/рәк,
and the superlative degree of an adjective or adverb is modified through adverb _иң_ "(the) most".
We annotate the former on the adjective with the `Degree` feature, and the latter on the adverb.

### <a name="Cmp">`Cmp`</a>: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another object.

#### Examples

* _яхшы<b>рак</b>_  "better"
* _монда<b>рак</b>_  "precisely here"

### <a name="Sup">`Sup`</a>: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other objects within a set.

#### Examples

* _иң яхшы_  "best"
