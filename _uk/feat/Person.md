Person is a feature of personal [pronouns](uk-pos/PRON) and of [verbs](uk-pos/VERB). On verbs it is in fact an agreement feature that marks the person of the verb's subject. Person marked on verbs makes it unnecessary to always add a personal pronoun as subject and thus subjects are sometimes dropped (Ukrainian is a pro-drop language).

### <a name="0">`0`</a>: zero person

Zero person is for impersonal statements.

#### Examples

* _Проект Barracuda так і не було <b>закінчено</b>._ “The Barracuda project was never <b>completed</b>.”

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional persons.

#### Examples

* _<b>робимо</b>&nbsp;_ “<b>we</b> do”

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and optionally some third persons too.

#### Examples

* _<b>робиш</b>&nbsp;_ “<b>you</b>`Sing` do”
* _<b>робите</b>&nbsp;_ “<b>you</b>`Plur` do”

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither speakers nor addressees.
