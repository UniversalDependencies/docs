### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words typically denoting events and actions, constituting a minimal predicate in a clause, governing the number and types of dependents which may occur in the clause. In Italian verbs are associated with grammatical properties such as: tense, mood and person, which can either be expressed inflectionally or using auxiliary verbs or particles.

Note that the `VERB` tag covers main verbs (content verbs) but it does not cover auxiliary verbs and, **from version 2**, copulas, for which the [AUX]() tag is used. 

Participles used as adjectives are classified as [ADJ]().
