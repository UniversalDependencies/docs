Case helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence.
For example, the nominative and accusative cases often distinguish subject and object of the verb,
while in fixed-word-order languages these functions would be distinguished merely by the positions of the nouns in the sentence.

In Kyrgyz, case is an inflectional feature of [nouns](ky-pos/NOUN).  In some cases, [numerals](ky-pos/NUM)) may also be inflected for case when they are used as nouns.
It is also valency feature of [postpositions](ky-pos/ADP) (saying that the adposition requires its argument to be in that case).

Traditionally, Kyrgyz is considered to have 6 cases (nominative is
often not listed): `Nom`, `Acc`, `Gen`, `Dat`, `Loc`, `Abl`.
We also consider suffix *-нан* as a case suffix introducing comitative or instrumental case, and mark it as `Ins` (although the function may sometimes be `Com` in some of these cases, currently we do not distinguish the two).

### <a name="Nom">`Nom`</a>: nominative / direct

The base form of the noun, typically used as citation form (lemma).

#### Examples

* _<b>кыз</b> уктап жатат._ "The <b>girl</b> sleeps."

### <a name="Acc">`Acc`</a>: accusative

Typically, accusative case in Kyrgyz marks the definite direct object in a sentence.
Indefinite direct objects do not receive the accusative suffix,
but stays in bare form (`Nom`).

In Kyrgyz`Acc` is expressed by suffix _-(т)ы_ (_ы/и/у/ү/ты/ти/ту/тү_).

#### Examples

* _Мен китеп-<b>ти</b> окудум_ "I read-PAST the book" (cf. _Мен китепти окудум_ "I read a book" / "I read books")

### <a name="Dat">`Dat`</a>: dative

Dative case is typically used to indicate movement into/towards/to a place or time.
The oblique arguments of some verbs and complements (noun phrases) of some postpositions also required to be in dative case.

In Kyrgyz`Dat` is expressed by suffix _-(г)а_ , _-(к)а_(_е/а/га/ка/ге/ке_).

#### Examples

* _Мен Бишкек-<b>ке</b> бара жатам._ "I am going <b>to</b> Bishkek"
* _Китепти Али-<b>ге</b> бериңиз_ "Give the book <b>to</b> Ali"
* _Жамгыр-<b>га</b> карабай ойноп жатышат_ "They are playing despite the rain" 


### <a name="Gen">`Gen`</a>: genitive

Prototypical meaning of genitive is that the noun phrase somehow belongs to its governor; it would often be translated by the English preposition _of_.
Complements of some postpositions are also required to be in genitive case.
The genitive morpheme also marks the subject of the subordinate clauses.

In Kyrgyz`Gen` is expressed by suffix _-(д)ин_,(т)ин_, _(н)ин_.

#### Examples

* _Али<b>нин</b> китеби._ "Ali<b>'s</b> book"
* _Мен<b>ин</b> машинам бар._ "I have a car."

### <a name="Loc">`Loc`</a>: locative

The locative case often expresses location in space or time, which gave it its name.
The oblique arguments of some verbs and complements (noun phrases) also required to be in locative case.

In Kyrgyz`Loc` is expressed by suffix _-то,-да_.

#### Examples

* _Талас шаарын<b>да</b> айдоочуларды даярдоочу мектептер текшерилүүдө._ "Driving training schools are being inspected in Talas."
* _Сузак<b>та</b> селден жабыркаган 8 үй-бүлөгө үй курулууда._ "Houses are being built for 8 flood-affected families in Suzak."


### <a name="Ins">`Ins`</a>: instrumental

The role from which the name of the instrumental case is derived is that the noun is used as instrument to do something.
In Kyrgyz, instrumental suffix _-нен_ also indicates comitative,
or signal coordination of two phrases.
We mark all meanings/usages as `Ins`.
The oblique arguments of some verbs and complements (noun phrases) of some postpositions also required to carry the instrumental suffix.

#### Examples

* _Бишкекте Кытай өкмөтүнүн гранттык каражаттарынын эсеби<b>нен</b> каржылануучу долбоорлор талкууланды._ "Projects funded by grants from the Chinese government were discussed in Bishkek." (instrumental)
* _Бишкекте айымдарга Садыр Жапаровдун аты<b>нан</b> жоолуктар тапшырылды._ "Women in Bishkek were presented with scarves on behalf of Sadyr Japarov." (instrumental)

### <a name="Abl">`Abl`</a>: ablative

Prototypical meaning: direction from some point.
The oblique arguments of some verbs and complements (noun phrases) of some postpositions also required to be in ablative case.

#### Examples

* _Бул кат Петир<b>ден</b> жана кечээ жөнөтүлгөн._ "This letter is <b>from</b> Peter and was sent yesterday."
* _Кумтөр<b>дөн</b> быйыл 500 миллион долларга чейин киреше алабыз._ "We will get up to 500 million dollars <b>from</b>Kumtor this year."

### <a name="Equ">`Equ`</a>: equative

The equative case means “X-like”, “similar to X”, “same as X”. It marks the
standard of comparison and it differs from the equative [Degree](), which
marks the property being compared. It occurs in Kyrgyz.

#### Examples

* _Ал ага <b>окшоп</b> чуркай алат._ "She can run <b>like</b> him.."
