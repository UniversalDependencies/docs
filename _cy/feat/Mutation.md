Initial mutation is a phenomenon of all Celtic languages. Under certain positional or syntactic conditions, the initial consonant of a word may change. Historically a Sandhi phenomenon, mutations are today purely morphologically or syntactically triggered. Any word can be mutated (proper nouns, nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions)

Welsh has tree mutations, Soft Mutation, Nasal Mutation and Aspirate Mutation. Not all consonsants can undergo mutations.

consonant    | Soft Mutation                | Nasal Mutation                | Aspirate Mutation
------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -----------------
d  _dant_    | dd _ei ddant_ "his tooth"    | n   _yn Nulyn_ "in Dublin"    |
g  _gwlad_   | -  _ei wlad_ "his country"   | ng  _fy ngwlad_ "my country"  |
b  _bara_    | f  _dy fara_ "your bred"     | m   _fy mara_ "my bred"       |
m  _munud_   | f  _dwy funud_ "two minutes" | 
c  _car_     | g  _ei gar_ "his car"        | ngh _fy nghar_ "my car"       | ch _ei char_ "her car"
t  _taith_   | d  _dwy daith_ "two voyages" | nh  _fy nhaith_ "my voyage"   | th _a thaith_ "and [a] voyage"
p  _plant_   | b  _ei blant_ "his children" | mh  _fy mhlant_ "my children" | ph _ei phlant_ "her children"
ll _llwy_    | l  _ei lwy_ "his spoon"      | 
rh _rhan_    | r  _ei ran_ "his part"       |
vowel _afal_ |                              |                               | h  _ein hafal_ "our apple"


There are cases where the meaning is only indicated by the mutation: E.g. the gender of the possessor of the possessive pronoun _ei_ "his" or "her" is given by the mutation of the following word: _ei gar_ (soft mutation): "his car", but _ei char_ (aspirate mutation): "her car". If the word following _ei_ does not mutate, _ei_ remains ambiguous: _ei afal_ "his/her apple".
Another example is 
* _Canodd o_ "he sang" (no mutation of the verb)
* _Ganodd o?_ "did he sing" (soft mutation of the verb due to a dropped question marker _a_)
* _Chanodd o [ddim]_ "he did not sing" (aspirate mutation after the dropped negation marker _ni_)

### <a name="SM">`SM`</a>: soft mutation

The soft mutation is by far the most frequent mutation.

#### Examples

* feminin nouns after the definit article: _cath_ "cat", _y **g**ath_ "the cat"
* adjectives which modify a feminin noun: _bach_ "little", _merch **f**ach_ "a little girl"
* words following the possessive pronouns _ei_ "his" and _dy_ "your": _dy dŷ_ "your house"
* words following prepositions like _o_ "from", or _ar_ "on": _o **G**aerdydd_ "from Cardiff"
* words following the numerals _dau_ and _dwy_ ("two (masc/fem)": _dau **dd**yn_ "two men", _dwy **f**erch_ "two women"
* indefinite direct objects: _mi welodd hi **dd**yn_ "she saw a man"
* adverbial clauses: _mi ddaeth o **dd**oe_ "he came yesterday"

### <a name="NM">`NM`</a>: nasal mutation

In spoken Welsh the nasal mutation is sometimes replaced by the soft mutation, especially after the prepositio, _yn_, "in"

#### Examples

* words following the possessive pronouns _fy_ "my": _fy **nh**ŷ_ "my house"
* words following the preposition _yn/ym/yng_ "in": _ym **M**angor_, _yng **Ngh**aerdydd_, _yn nau fil tri_ "in 2003"
* some words following the numeral _deg_ "ten": _deng **m**lywydd_ "ten years"

### <a name="AM">`AM`</a>: aspirate mutation

#### Examples

* words following the numerals _tri_ "three" and _chwech_ "six": _tri **th**ŷ_ "three houses", _chwech **ch**ant_ "six hundred"
* words following the possessive pronouns _ei_ "her": _ei **ph**en_ "her head" 
* words following the conjunction _a_ "and" and negation markers _ni_ and _na_: _nain a **th**aid_ "grandmother and grandfather"
* words following prepositions like _gyda_ "with": _gyda thân_ "with fire"
