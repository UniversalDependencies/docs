An auxiliary is a function word which accompanies the verbal predicate and provides information regarding tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality.
 
Auxiliaries in Guajajara are verbal predicates which coreference the subject and (optionally) the object of the clause. They generally follow the main verb, but other syntactic elements may be placed between the main predicate and its auxiliary.

Some auxiliaries offer aspectual information regarding the main verb, such as the progressive aspect:

~~~ sdparse
Mon aipo ur iko aʔe \n Who is coming?
aux(ur, iko)
~~~

Tupi-Guaraní languages include the so-called positional auxiliaries, which provide information regarding the position of the subject:

~~~ sdparse
iʔi zekaipo zawaruhu in ɨwɨkwar pupe \n the jaguar spoke, seated, from inside the hole.
3-say N.Att-Past jaguar sit hole from
aux(iʔi, in)
~~~
