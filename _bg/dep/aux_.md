An aux (auxiliary) of a clause is a function word associated with a verbal predicate that expresses categories such as tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality. 
In Bulgarian the following categories are included: auxiliary verbs that form analytic verb forms like analytic tenses, participial passive, conditional; auxiliary particles _да_ da "то" and _ще_ shte "will".
