A clausal complement of a verb or adjective is a dependent clause which is a core argument. That is, it functions like an object of the verb, or adjective.

~~~ sdparse
Mikko trodde jo at jeg skulle ta ham \n Mikko thought that I was going to get him
ccomp(trodde,ta)
~~~

Such clausal complements may be finite or nonfinite. However, if the subject of the clausal complement is controlled the appropriate relation is [xcomp]().
