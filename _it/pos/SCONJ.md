### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions
by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating
conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the
status of a (subordinate) clause.

We recognize these two subclasses as subordinating conjunctions:

* Complementizers, _come_ "like", _che_ "that", _mentre_ "while", _se_ "if"
* Adverbial clause introducers, _come_ "like", _quando_ "when", _poiché, perché_ "since", or _prima_ "before" (when introducing a clause not a nominal)

For _coordinating conjunctions_ see [CCONJ]().
