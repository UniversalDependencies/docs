* _acl:relcl_ for relative clauses
* _advmod:emph_ for adverbial modifiers of noun phrases)
* _aux:caus_ for causative auxiliaries
* _case:loc_ for postpositional localizers
* _compound:lvc_ for light compound verbs
* _compound:redup_ for reduplicated compounds
* _compound:svc_ for serial compound verbs
* _csubj:pass_ for clausal subjects of passive verbs
* _det:poss_ for possessive determiners
* _iobj:agent_ for agentive indirect objects of causative verbs
* _nmod:obl_ for oblique modifiers
* _nmod:poss_ for possessive modifiers
* _nsubj:caus_ for nominal subjects of causative verbs
* _nsubj:pass_ for nominal subjects of passive verbs
* _obl:agent_ for agents of passive verbs

The syntactic annotation has been checked manually and corrected on a systematic basis.
