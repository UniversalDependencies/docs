### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [verbs](VERB) for such categories as time, place, direction or manner. They may also modify
[adjectives](ADJ) and other adverbs, as in _<b>дуже</b> важливо&nbsp;_ “very significantly” or _<b>явно</b> неправильний&nbsp;_ “provably wrong”.

There is a closed subclass of _pronominal adverbs_ that refer to circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly; similarly
to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, relative, demonstrative etc. Pronominal adverbs also get the `ADV`
part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional features.

<!--In accord with the UD approach, adverbial ordinal numerals _(вперше, вдруге)&nbsp;_ are tagged `ADV`, although the traditional grammar classifies them as adverbs. The same holds for multiplicative numerals _(двічі, семикратно).&nbsp;_ -->

### Examples
- _дуже&nbsp;_ “very”
- _добре&nbsp;_ “well”
- _точно&nbsp;_ “exactly”
- _завтра&nbsp;_ “tomorrow”
- _вгору, вниз&nbsp;_ “up, down”
- ordinal numeral adverbs: _вперше, вдруге, втретє&nbsp;_ “for the first time, for the second time, for the third time”
- multiplicative numeral adverbs: _двічі, тричі&nbsp;_ “twice, three times”
- interrogative adverbs: _де, куди, коли, як, чому&nbsp;_ “where, where to, when, how, why”
- demonstrative adverbs: _тут, там, зараз, тоді, так&nbsp;_ “here, there, now, then, so”
- indefinite adverbs: _десь, кудись, іноді, якось&nbsp;_ “somewhere, to somewhere, sometime, somehow”
- total adverbs: _всюди, завжди&nbsp;_ “everywhere, always”
- negative adverbs: _ніде, ніколи&nbsp;_ “nowhere, never”
