obl is split in three subrelations: [obl:ad](), [obl:comp](), and [obl:periph]().

The `obl:periph` relation is used for peripheric obliques, i.e obliques which are not governed by their heads. When the oblique element is governed however, we use the [obl:comp]() relation for arguments and the [obl:ad]() relation for adjuncts.

Peripheric elements are more clause dependent than verb dependent and cannot be clefted.
