Pronominal type is a feature of (some) pronouns, determiners and pronominal adverbs in Swedish.

### <a name="Prs">`Prs`</a>: personal or possessive personal pronoun or determiner

See also the [Poss]() feature that distinguishes normal personal
pronouns from possessives. Note that `Prs` also includes reflexive
personal/possessive pronouns.

#### Examples

* _jag, du, han, hon, sig, vi_

### <a name="Rcp">`Rcp`</a>: reciprocal pronoun

This value is used for pronouns that are specifically reciprocal. If a reflexive pronoun can be used to convey reciprocal meaning,
it is still labeled as reflexive (`PronType=Prs|Reflex=Yes`). It is not marked as reciprocal in contexts in which it is used
reciprocally.

Reciprocal means that there is a plural subject and every member of the group does the thing described by the predicate to
every other member of the group. A reciprocal pronoun is used in the object position to signal such configuration.

#### Examples

* _varandra_ “each other”

### <a name="Art">`Art`</a>: article

Article is a special case of determiner that bears the feature of
[definiteness](Definite).

#### Examples

* _en, ett, den, de, det_

### <a name="Int">`Int`</a>: interrogative pronoun, determiner, or adverb

#### Examples:

* Pronouns: _vem_ "who", _vad_ "what"
* Determiners: _vilken_ (common singular) "which", _vilket_ (neuter singular) "which", _vilka_ (plural) "which"
* Adverbs: _när_ "when", _var_ "where", _hur_ "how"

### <a name="Rel">`Rel`</a>: relative pronoun, determiner, or adverb

#### Examples:

* Pronouns: _som_ "that", _vilken_ "who"
* Determiners: _vars_, _vilkens_ "whose"
* Adverbs: _då_ "when", _där_ "where"

<b>Note:</b> Many Swedish pronouns can be used in both interrogative and relative clauses, and these uses are not fully disambiguated in the annotation, which means that pronouns are often assigned the feature `PronType=Int,Rel`. 


### <a name="Dem">`Dem`</a>: demonstrative pronoun, determiner, numeral or adverb

#### Examples

* _detta, denna, dessa, denne, dennes_

### <a name="Tot">`Tot`</a>: total (collective) pronoun, determiner or adverb

#### Examples

* _alla, allt, varje_

### <a name="Neg">`Neg`</a>: negative pronoun, determiner or adverb

Negative pronominal words are distinguished from negating [particles](u-pos/PART)
and from words that inflect for polarity (verbs, adjectives etc.) Those words
do not use `PronType=Neg`, they use `Polarity=Neg` instead. See the
[Polarity]() feature for further details.

#### Examples:

* _ingen, ingenting, inget, inga_

### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indefinite pronoun, determiner, numeral or adverb

#### Examples

* _man, någon, något, samma, några, en, andra_
