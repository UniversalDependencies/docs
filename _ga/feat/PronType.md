### `Art` : articles

Pronominal articles in Irish include the definite articles _an_ or _na_. These articles can combine with prepositions to create new forms, e.g., _an_ + _de_ = _den_ (“from the”), _an_ + _faoi_ = _faoin_ (“under the”), _na_ + _i_ = _sna_ (“in the”).

#### Examples

* _<b>an</b> tuairim_ “the opinion”
* _<b>na</b> seirbhíse_ “the services”
* _<b>san</b> áit_ “in the place”
* _<b>faoin</b> suíochán_ “under the seat”

### `Dem` : demonstrative

Irish demonstrative pronouns indicate nearness to the speaker, whether this is a difference of time or space. There are three main degrees of closeness: near to the speaker (_seo_, “this/these”), of some distance to the speaker (_sin_, “that/those”), and of greater distance to the speaker (_siúd, úd_, “that/those over there”).

#### Examples

* _Caithfidh mé <b>sin</b> a fhoghlaim_ “I have to learn <b>that</b>”
* _an ceo <b>seo</b>_ “<b>this</b> fog” 
* _Ina measc <b>siúd</b>_ “in the midst of <b>that</b>”

### `Ind` : indefinite

Indefinite pronouns are used to refer to unspecified quantities or persons.

#### Examples

* _beidh <b>cibé</b> méid ann_ “there will be <b>however</b> many there”
* _ní raibh <b>aon</b> duine acu ag goil_ “nobody (lit. not one person of them) was crying”
* _ar gach <b>uile</b> Chaitliceach_ “at every single Catholic”

### `Int` : interrogative

The interrogative pronouns can be used to specify or question a specific noun. The pronouns used for inanimate things include _cén, cad, céard, cathain, conas_ and _cá_, while  _cé_ can be used for persons, places or things. These interrogative pronouns can be combined with other nouns to form common question phrases, such as _cén fáth_ (“what reason”), and _cé mhéad_ (“how many”)

#### Examples

* _<b>cén</b> tréimhse a bhí i gceist_ “<b>which</b> period was in question”
* _<b>cad</b> é sin?_ “<b>what</b> is that?”
* _<b>cé</b> atá ag comóradh_ “<b>who</b> is assembling”

### `Prs` : person


### `Rel` : relative

The relative pronoun in Irish is _<b>a</b>_ (or _ná_), and is used to introduce a relative clause or adverbial clause. It can combine with other words, such as the possible combinations with the present form of the verb _bí_ “to be”, as in _atá_ or _atáimse_, with the copula _is_, as in _ab_,  or with the preposition _le_ “with”, as in _lena_.

#### Examples

* _le grúpa <b>a</b> bhí ag iarraidh_ “with a group <b>that</b> was trying”
* _<b>a</b> dúirt sí_ “she said”
* _File <b>ab</b> ea Dónall Ó Muláin_ “(lit. it was a poet <b>that</b> Dónall Ó Muláin was)”
* _seanáiteanna <b>atá</b> luaite sa leabhar_ “old places <b>that are</b> mentioned in the book”
