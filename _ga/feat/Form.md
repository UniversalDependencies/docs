One of the characteristics of Irish is its tendency for initial mutation to occur in certain circumstances. This is triggered by the preceding word and affects the spelling of nouns, adjectives and verbs. Nouns in Irish are divided into classes according to the way they are inflected to form the genitive singular. There are five such noun-classes or declensions. (The Christian Brothers, 1994)

### `Ecl` : eclipsis

This feature occurs when the initial consonant or vowel of a word is eclipsed by a prefixing consonant. This is either a voiced consonant for voiceless consonants, (e.g. /tʲ/ → /dʲ/, /k/ → /g/) or a nasalised consonant for voiced consonants (e.g. /dʲ/ → /nʲ/, /g/ → /ŋ/). Vowels are eclipsed by adding _<b>n-</b>_ or _<b>t-</b>_. 

Not every consonant can experience eclipsis. The consonants that can be eclipsed in Irish are: p, b, t, d, c, g and f.

Eclipsis will happen in a number of environments:

* after the plural possessive nouns _<b>ár, bhur</b>_ and _<b>a</b>_ ("our", "your (pl.)", "their")
* on singular count nouns following the numbers 7-10
* after the preposition _<b>i</b>_ "in"
* on plural nouns in the genitive case after the definite article
* on singular nouns in the dative case after the definite article
* following certain clitics such as interrogative particles (_<b>an, nach</b>_), complementisers (_<b>go, nach</b>_) and relativisers (_<b>a, nach</b>_)

#### Examples

* _a <b>g</b>cuid iarrachtaí_ “their efforts”
* _seacht <b>m</b>bliana_ “seven years”
* _i <b>n</b>Gaeilge_ “in Irish”
* _costas na <b>n-</b>oibreacha_ “cost of the works” 
* _ar an <b>bh</b>focal_ “on the word”
* _nach <b>bh</b>faca sé_ “he didn’t see”

### `Emp` : emphatic

The emphatic form is a special form a word takes to mark emphasis in Irish.

#### Examples

* _dom_ “to me”
* _dom<b>sa</b>_ “to me (emph)”
* _a deirim_ “I said”
* _a deirim<b>se</b>_ “I (emph) said”

### `Len` : lenition

Lenition is by far the most common means of initial mutation in the treebank. When lenited, <b>h</b> is added immediately after the initial consonant. 

These are some of the environments that trigger lenition:

* following the definite article (see [Definite]() for specifics)
* following the vocative particle _<b>a</b>_ (see [PartType](), [Case]())
* after certain adjectives (singular possessive pronouns, _<b>uile, aon, dhá,</b>_ etc.)
* after certain simple prepositions (_<b>a,  de, do, faoi,</b>_ etc.)
* following the past tense of the copula _<b>is</b>_
* following preverbal particles in the past tense (_<b>níor, ar,</b>_ etc.)
* verb forms in the past tense

#### Examples

* _an f<b>h</b>arraige_ “the sea”
* _A D<b>h</b>ochtúir Van Helsing_ “Doctor Van Helsing”
* _mo c<b>h</b>uid oibre_ “my work”
* _faoi c<b>h</b>eist_ “under question”
* _Ba m<b>h</b>aith liom_ “I would like”
* _Níor c<b>h</b>uir sin_ “that doesn’t put”
* _t<b>h</b>áinig_ “came”

### `HPref` : h-prefix

When two vowels come together in Irish, a h-prefix is inserted before the second vowel in order to simplify pronunciation.

#### Examples

* _go <b>h</b>álainn_ “lovely”
* _na <b>h</b>eisimirce_ “emigration”
* _de <b>h-</b>Íde_ “from Íde”
* _ní <b>h</b>amháin_ “not only”

### `VF` : Vowel form

Vowel form is an indicator of spelling changes that occur in copular verbs when followed by a word that begins with a vowel or a lenited consonant.

#### Examples

* _is_ copula, “is”
* _<b>ab</b> ea iad_ “they are”
* _<b>gurbh</b> é_ “it was”
* _<b>B’</b>fhearr leis_ lit. “it was better for him”
