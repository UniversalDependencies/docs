Boolean feature marking a word as an abbreviation.

Note that UD Finnish does not differentiate between different types of
shortened forms. In particular, there is no separate feature
identifying acronyms, which are also marked with `Abbr=Yes`.

### `Yes`: word is abbreviation

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not an abbreviation,
the `Abbr` feature will not appear.

#### Examples

* [fi] _mm._ "among others"
* [fi] _esim._ "for example"
* [fi] _USA_, _EU_
