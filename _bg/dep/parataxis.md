The [parataxis]() relation is a relation between a word (often the main predicate of a sentence) and other elements, such as a sentential parenthetical or a clause after a “:” or a “;”, placed side by side without any explicit coordination, subordination, or argument relation with the head word. 

In Bulgarian this relation is mainly used between a speech verb and an embedded reported speech. Irrespevtively of the linear position of the speech verb, it is always the head of the relation
