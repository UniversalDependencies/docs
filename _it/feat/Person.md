Person is typically feature of personal and possessive
[pronouns](u-pos/PRON) / [determiners](u-pos/DET), and of [verbs](u-pos/VERB). On verbs it is in
fact an agreement feature that marks the person of the verb's subject. Person
marked on verbs makes it unnecessary to always add a personal pronoun
as subject and thus subjects may be dropped, as is the case in Italian.

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons. 

#### Examples

* _io_ "I", _noi_ "we"
* _mio_ "my", _miei_ "my", _nostra_ "our"
* _andavo_ "I was going", _corremmo_ "we ran"

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the
utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and
optionally some third persons too.

#### Examples

* _tu_ "you", _voi_ "you"
* _tuo_ "your", _vostra_ "your"
* _canti_ "you sing", _dicevate_ "you were saying"

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither
speakers nor addressees.

#### Examples

* _lui_ "he", _lei_ "she", _egli_ "he", _loro_ "they"
* _loro_ "their", _sua_ "her"
* _legge_ "she reads", _abbracciano_ "they hug"
