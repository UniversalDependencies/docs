Degree of comparison is used as an inflectional feature of [adjectives](_ka/pos/ADJ). The degree of comparison is encoded in Georgian by two methods: synthetic and analytic. The synthetic method of forming the degree of comparison is closely connected to the use of special affixes, while the analytic method employs the adverbs _უფრო_ ‘more’ (in the comparative degree) and _ყველაზე_ ‘most’, _ყველაზე უფრო_ ‘most of all’ (in the superlative degree) before the adjective. While the synthetic method can be processed as a part of morphology, the analytic envolves syntax.

### <a name="Dim">`Dim`</a>: comparative, second degree

The diminutive degree (the so-called ‘-ish degree’) expresses a lesser degree, small size, or, metaphorically, affection towards the entity described by the noun.

#### Examples

* _კაბა <b>მო</b>თეთრ<b>ო</b>ა._ "The dress is slightly white."
* _კაბა <b>ოდნავ</b> თეთრია._ "The dress is slightly white."


### <a name="Pos">`Pos`</a>: comparative, second degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something, without comparing it to qualities of others. 

#### Examples

* _კაბა თეთრია._ "The dress is white."

### <a name="Cmp">`Cmp`</a>: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another object.

#### Examples

* _კაბა <b>უფრო</b> თეთრია, ვიდრე ჩანთა._ "The dress is whiter than the bag."

### <a name="Sup">`Sup`</a>: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other objects within a set.

#### Examples

* _კაბა <b>უ</b>თეთრ<b>ეს</b>ია._ "The dress is the whitest."
* _კაბა <b>ყველაზე უფრო</b> თეთრია._ "The dress is the whitest in comparison with others."
