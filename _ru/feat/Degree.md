Degree of comparison is inflectional feature of some
[adjectives](ru-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](ru-pos/ADV).

### `Pos`: positive, first degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something,
without comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this
degree is traditionally called "positive", negative properties can be
compared, too.

#### Examples

* _<b>умный</b> человек&nbsp;_ “<b>clever</b> man”

### `Cmp`: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object.

#### Examples

* _этот человек <b>умнее</b> меня&nbsp;_ “the man is <b>cleverer</b> than me”

### `Sup`: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set.

#### Examples

* _это <b>наиумнейший</b> человек в нашей команде&nbsp;_ “this is the <b>cleverest</b> man in our team”
