### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [verbs](VERB) for such
categories as time, place, direction or manner. They may also modify
[adjectives](ADJ) and other adverbs, as in _<b>very briefly</b>_ or
_<b>arguably</b> wrong_.

There is a closed subclass of _pronominal adverbs_ that refer to
circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly; similarly
to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, relative,
demonstrative etc. Pronominal adverbs also get the `ADV`
part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional features.

Note that in Germanic languages, some adverbs may also function as
verbal particles, as in _write <b>down</b>_ or _end <b>up</b>_.  They
are still tagged `ADV` and not [PART]().

Note that there are words that may be traditionally called numerals in
some languages (e.g. Czech) but they are treated as adverbs in our
universal tagging scheme. In particular, _adverbial ordinal numerals_
([cs] _poprv√©_ "for the first time") and _multiplicative numerals_
(e.g. _once, twice_) behave syntactically as adverbs and are tagged
`ADV`.

Note that there are verb forms such as _transgressives_ or _adverbial
participles_ that share properties and usage of adverbs and
verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as
either [VERB]() or `ADV`.
