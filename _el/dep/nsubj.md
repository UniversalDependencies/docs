TODO
(See [csubj]() for when the subject is clausal. See [nsubjpass]() and [csubjpass]() for when the subject is not the proto-agent argument due to valence changing operations.)
The governor of the `nsubj` relation might not always be a verb: when
the verb is a copular verb, the root of the clause is the complement
of the copular verb, which can be an adjective or noun.
