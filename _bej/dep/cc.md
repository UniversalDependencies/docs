A coordination is the relation between an element of a conjunct and the coordinating conjunction word of the conjunct.  
(Note: different dependency grammars have different treatments of coordination.  
We take one conjunct of a conjunction (normally the first) as the head of the conjunction.) 
This is also called a `cc`, and dependent on the root predicate of the sentence.
