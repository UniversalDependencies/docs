### Definition

Tupinambá only has postpositions.
They occur after a complement noun phrase (or a nominal subordinate clause) and they form a single structure with the complement to express its grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.
Postpositions combine with the contiguity/non-contiguity markers indicating whether argument of the postposition is the preceding element ([Rel=Cont]()) 
or its is discontinuous or absent ([Rel=NCont]())


### Examples

- _ʃe=<b>∅-pɨri</b>_ "<b>near me</b> "
- _aβá_<b>r-esé</b> "<b>with men</b>"
